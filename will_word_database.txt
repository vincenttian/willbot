ppl getting scammed and shit
pretty wild westtypical high risk high reward dynamics

no real details yetive just been reading up on bitcointalk
<@U087XT8AX>: <@U0882HKA7> any interest?
Im considering looking into altcoin
truly the next big wave is about data curation
it feels like this could be a whole new revolution where before computers/internet enabled widespread dissemination of information, now computers/internet enable widespread processing of information
1 pb on amzn costs 17k
you can start crowdsourcing computing power to execute massive scale projects so that the ordinary person can start to compete with any large enterprise in terms of raw computing powerright now its not that liquid
all that kind of computing power makes folding@home kind of projects much more possiblethink about kickstarters asking not for cash but computing power
see ya
and all server power across Google, MS, AMZN, server farms, etc. makes up only 6%
apparently, all of googles server power amounts to 1% of all bitcoin mining computing power
and all this via just the bitcoin mining community as proof of concept
in which case actual computing power becomes transactableyou can see people doing much much more with their ordinary computers and access to cloud computing
as opposed to server farms
ultra low human operating costs
according to them, theyll be selling space cheaper than amazon, google drive, etc.
lots of cool applications
yeah
just a little worried we might lose a spot at the table after they talk to bigger vc's
yeah, looks like a very cool concept and great traction
yeah
im hoping to invest haha
yeah
or if you think its a cool idea, you can get involved at no cost and no reward
if you have 10k storjcoin (sjcx) ~$600, then you can start getting paid for your space too
theyre going to launch their test group b tmrw i think
yeah
allow people to run their own mini servers
imagine when you start paying people for their disk space
except folding@home basically asks people to donate space
or seti@home, the precursor
yeah!
let companies store their encrypted data onto spare disk space of random people around the world

bitcoin specifically?
hahaha
maybeit shoudlnt be

it makes it just a subtree of the larger blockchain industry
but since bitcoin uses blockchain as a core technology
maybe not laterally
i think theyre pretty similar

land of the free to land of the [trigger warning]
yeah lol
yeah
right right
when i hear that, i know im getting a tirade
thats a fucking trigger warning
than the word offensive"
sureid rather hear a thesis
then person b should just leave
either aggressor or aggressed
remove person from situation
and theres no possible way for everybody to get together and determine what is not hurtful and what is
or Where are you from?"
im sure theres one person out there who legitimately feels threatened when someone says America is the land of opportunity"
right, its a pretty gray area
damn low*
i bet this article makes the point that the threshold is too damn high
well theres thresholds right
ehill just keep reading
as if they arent ppl at all
with no concern at all for the emotional well-being for those non-pc people
where pc people apply this thats bad argument to non-pc people, but if non-pc people say thats bad then theyre censored or shat on
theres this kind of double standard
right
hm i see
i think its importantdissenting views are important to consider
it is though
so it can work against common sense, and even what we might term progress"
but, like most things in life, its double-edged
its just as beautiful a testimony"
and this girl was like, thats what makes sociology so greatany one persons view is as valuable as a majority goups view"
like, <@U0882HKA7> and i were talking to some of my friends last night about the discussion we had about culture v infrastructure in shaping the ideas around family ties
rightbut anyones view is as valid as any other's
that emotional harm is just as legitimately harmful as physical
trigger warnings are rooted in the idea that words do hurt
and thats why the comparison is made to the campaign in the  80s against hate speech
its a tough line to draw

lol do you need a trigram?
thats what i had in mind
ah ok, yeah thats what i had in mind
what do you have in mind?
shouldnt the trigram alone be related enough?
jehehe
youre pretty much a bot for bots
hows that meta?
wait, is it triggering with  will bot or withrandom trigrams
hm yeah
jehehe
hm yeah
yeah
respond to trigrams it currently has stored
like instead of responding to the x-bot" command
when it sees a bigram that it has?
can you code it to randomly interject once in a while?
maybe itll die out in a few weeks tho
haha
yeah host this!
<@U0882HKA7>: you should blacklist the bot commands when pulling bigrams

why did they give you that training?

...
after playing catan
idk man
lmao

but no ones wired that way
like i think if people were more open to thinking and less about winning life would be so much simpler
guh
news sources are hard
LOL
i also feel that nyt is a bit much sometimes
hm
did they say that on the record?
that was weird
yeah it is
i feel that way bc they dont do active pieces on how things should change but just complain about random things
not because they actually believe it
idk i feel like they push their liberal agenda since its the most profitable among yuppie millennials
haah
this didnt help
i really dont like jezebel though
exactly
not at all like the slaves directly benefited
slaves using knowledge on farms, against their will (being slaves), makes it seem manipulated
I totally dipute it
weird
but thats because I believe in one group, one voice
haha, I think you are
and i think its important for history to show each voice, while noting what is majority and what is not (most or some or rarely are good signposts for instance)
not majority group, majority voice
sociology is premised on the idea that one group, one voice
if it does
and is that bad?
do you think sociology distorts truth then?
interesting
though I cnat speak to my unconscious intent, etc.
and I do not mean to be deliberately against the author
which goes completely against the author
Idk, I just think the publishers have a shitty job, and they did really well
less lazy and clumsy, more resigned to lazy and clumsy middle schoolers who like to binarize
but I also think this was a middle school textbook
I think they could have worded things better
haha
skimmed that part I guess
what was that
eh
you learn that there were random acts of kindness among Nazis too
in the same way that in hs, you dont learn that every German who served in the army was terrible
and evil
in fact, the textbook I think shows the multifaceted nature of slavery
so whats the issue
middle school students from texas*
I feel like noone, not even students, will come out of any education, esp not reading this textbook, that slavery was in any way ok
because Im not evil like all those shitty slave owners"
you think then that slavery is something that youre incapable of
thats what really breeds misunderstanding
wow, all slave owners were so bad
like
I really dont like when textbooks show only one side
yes, but thats what I think is important about it all
thats not untrue!
strange to me that we read it so differently
wait did the textbook ever say there were upsides to slavery?
feel like this should be in another channel haha
literallydid not see a single real problem
but the textbook itself has no real problems
what do you think the author is trying to say?
hence clickbaity
or even whitewash it in a way thats distinct from anything else in this patriarchal, cis white society"
subtle things that are mostly saying that it sounds like people want to say slavery wasnt that badbut the textbook, when I read it, didnt read like that. I agree, some of it could have been better worded, or was unnecessary. However, I dont see how thats trying to defend slavery
all the points are sheer semantics
thus, why it reminded me of the social media flame wars and sjw think
if you applied this kind of scrutiny to any textbook, you could say the same exact thing about anythinggay rights, trans rights, civil rights, etc.
anyways, just thought that this author is literally looking to poke holes at something that doesnt really have too many problems, just to make his real point, which seems to me, look at conservatives, look at texans, look at their shit education system"
they skimmed, at best
most of the other students I knew at msj def didnt read the textbook
idk about you, but I read the textbooks at hs and I still ended up being the most influenced by the teachers
teachers are who actually will deliver and execute on the material
first off, the textbook doesnt affect teachers one bit
which is pretty misleading
and defines a conservative pov
as if this textbook defines texas
however, the article focuses on that as the main issue
to argue on semantics in a middle school textbook, where people arent reading for subtlety seems useless
Textbooks arent the real issue, teachers are; as long as textbooks are impartial, and present the truth, whatever it is, thats the best we can ask for
heres my pov
and I was looking for tactics theyd use to try to get readers to just agree right away
yep
more skeptical than normal i guess
I approached it with what I was hoping was an open pov
i didnt read it at all that way
lollll
like obviously I dont want to defend saying that slavery had not bad parts to itthat most of it was all evil, but unfortunately real evil is pretty humdrum
idk its like an inconvenient truth
you cant bury one point away because not enough people felt this way"
thats sociology
<@U087XT8AX>: can you explain what the author said as to why this structure is bad for learning?
obviously I have strong opinions on this
That discourages critical thinking
i understand that the book might not be the most nuanced view. its a middle school text book. I think hes straight up wrong that the book discourages critical thinking. I dont see how offering an emotionally-charged, strongly-worded passage against slavery is going to help students think about the full picture. Reading persuasive writing in an informative textbook is just plain wrong
i really really dont like how he picks on a middle school textbook for not offering the nuanced views that sociology journals espouse for their academic readers
I read it and imo the text was pretty clear that it was bad, and the slaves had to cope
ppl should have the clear this is what was bad and this is how they made it work argument, and figure out that the bad is still bad
thats absolutely false
thats like saying that uncle toms cabin is a bad book because it implies that slavery was good at some points in the relationship
idk man
it wasnt good partsit was talking about suffering, and how the slaves coped
of course not
the argument is not so clean cut as that!
The textbooks attempt to actually be more unbiased and present what was the case is drowned out by overzealous sjws who think that history has to be rewritten to cast everybody whos against them in a negative light
this kind of shit makes me upseti feel like if this were better written, I might have even fallen for the sensationalism. It all feels a lot like the social media shaming flame wars
To say that all slave owners were pure evil, all slaves were pure good is totally mindless
like what is this author trying to advocate? All slave owners were pure evil ? I doubt hes that dumb. He clearly wants a nuanced discussion of what slavery waswhen he gets it, he says its not nuanced enough
seems like author really just wants to feed liberal readers the same drivel that Texans are evil people, texans are racists etc, when thats a gross overgeneralization. HMH is a national publisher, and to say that theyre trying to soften slavery is ridiculous. The text thats quoted as being riddled with omissions (btw, that sentence is pure deceptive wordplay, trying to conflate riddled with errors with omission, which, tbh isnt fair unless its quite clear theyre omitting a large part of slavery in a MIDDLE SCHOOL TEXTBOOKtheyre obviously not going to be able to fit all the nuances in properly) is not actually bad. It states both sides. Slavery did result in the formation of African-American cultures, and the family was a very large part of creating those cultures
and looks more sensationalist than anything else
lol this looks so so clickbaity

man should have made a separate channel for this..
Mr. Fontenot, who moved in in September and most often wears University of Michigan pajama pants and startup-company T-shirts, says hes found a sense of community in the house that he thought hed miss by leaving college. Anytime I have doubts about myself, I have the housemates right there, he says.

Whats more, he said he learns a lot from his housemates: Web technologies from Fouad Matin, 19, who is working on an education startup; the intricacies of Apples iOS mobile software from Messrs. Weinstein and Kramer; design tips from Jeremy Cai, 20, who left Babson College after one year and started a service to help companies hire contract employees.

The sense of community also impresses Mr. Weinsteins mother, who sees the environment as similar to college. She says her son appears happier pursuing his passion full time.

By October, Workflow still hadnt been approved by Apple. Messrs. Weinstein and Kramer considered another route. They applied to Y Combinator, attempting to follow the path of well-regarded startups such as home-rental site Airbnb and online-storage service Dropbox Inc.

WSJ.D

WSJ.D is the Journals home for tech news, analysis and product reviews.

Apple Recalls 222,000 Beats Pill XL Speakers
Disney Bets Big on Wearable, Internet-Connected Toys
SoftBank to Invest $1 Billion in Koreas Coupang
They were rejected. A Y Combinator partner said in an email that Workflow seemed like a solution with no real problem behind it. Their youth was troubling, the email continued, because the founders hadnt seen enough real workplace problems.

It sucked, says Mr. Kramer. It was not a fun time.

A few weeks later, things started to turn for Workflow. Apple finally accepted the app and the company scheduled its release for Dec. 11.

When it launched, Apple featured the app as an Editors Choice. Workflow, which sells for $2.99, shot to No. 1 in the App Store and stayed there nearly a week, earning more than 100,000 downloads in the first week.

Shortly after the app launched, Y Combinators Mr. Altman invited Messrs. Weinstein and Kramer to lunch. He said that Y Combinator should have considered them more closely and offered to invest personally in Workflow.

Workflow also garnered the attention of would-be rivals. Mark Pincus, co-founder of social-gaming company Zynga Inc., suggested they join forces with a stealth company he had started. Mr. Pincus told the pair he was looking for some scrappy guys who know how to build some magical sh. There was never a formal offer, but the team again chose to go it alone.

Mr. Pincus, who returned as Zyngas CEO last month, said he remembers meeting the Workflow team and discussing entrepreneurship.

Following the early success of the app, Mr. Weinstein looked to add staff. He ran into another rite of passage for startups: being outbid for talent.

Mr. Weinstein wanted to hire as a summer intern a Stanford University student who had done designs for Workflow. The student also had an internship offer from Facebook, for $6,300 a month. Mr. Weinstein offered to match the salary. A few weeks later, the student said Facebook, unprompted, raised its offer to $8,000. Mr. Weinstein conceded defeat.

He made another pitch. He asked Mr. Frey to move to San Francisco. Are you sure you want to keep doing this college thing? Mr. Weinstein texted.

Mr. Frey agreed to come. He didnt want to miss out. A month later, he moved into the house, sleeping on a mattress on the ground until a room opened up.

Like the Workflow founders, Messrs. Shah and Gulrajani were stars on the hackathon circuit. Mr. Shah dropped out of the University of Pittsburgh after his sophomore year. Mr. Gulrajani received a Thiel Fellowship and left MIT after one year.

In 2013, they started Watchsend, which helped app developers learn more about the problems users encountered with their apps. The company did well financially, but the founders lost interest.

Messrs. Shah and Gulrajani considered switching to focus on speech-recognition technology, and built a system that showed promise. Then, Chinese Internet giant Baidu Inc. published a research paper detailing a similar approach with better performance.

It revealed to us how easily large companies with lots of money could best us, Mr. Shah says. We didnt have that much of a competitive advantage by being very smart.

Watchsend shut operations in December and the pair moved out of the loft space. Mr. Shah said he doesnt regret leaving school early, but wishes he had thought more about the companys business plan. He and Mr. Gulrajani now work at separate machine-learning startups. Mr. Shah lives in a shared house with six 20-somethings, only one of whom has a college degree, he says.

The Workflow team, meanwhile, spent the summer refining its app. They hoped to time its release for a new version of iOS, Apples mobile-operating system. In August, they submitted it to the Apple team that screens software for the companys App Store. But Workflow wasnt approved in time for the Sept. 17 launch of iOS 8.

By this point, Mr. Frey had returned to Iowa for college. He had considered staying, but his parents were opposed, and I was scared of growing up too fast, he says.

Messrs. Weinstein and Kramer live at Mission Control with 10 others, including two women; half are under 21 years old. Three, including Messrs. Weinstein and Kramer, are Thiel Fellows. The house was originally leased by fellowship organizers for grant winners; other young entrepreneurs moved in as some initial residents left.

More dormitory than frat house, there is more working than partying at Mission Control. Residents come from varied backgrounds with diverse interests, but share some common traits: a brush with early success, disillusionment with the education system, an irreverent world view and healthy self-confidence.

The housemates share their schedules through a Google calendar and conduct group chats on Facebook Messenger, alerting each other to events like Wine-and-Cheese Wednesdays, Freestyle Fridays, and house dinners. There are impromptu all-night sessions of role-playing games such as Werewolf, but the most popular activity is tinkering with technology.

I dont think college is always bad, but our society seems to think college is always good, for everyone, at any costand that is what we have to question.

One recent weekend, a few housemates collaborated to manipulate the posts that users could see on Yik Yak, an anonymous social-networking service popular on college campuses.
He considered skipping MIT, but his parents resisted. After enrolling, Mr. Weinstein spent much of his freshman year traveling the country on the college hackathon circuit.

His first semester, he failed two classes because he was too focused on running his app and other projects to pay attention to school work.

At a hackathon at the University of Michigan early in his second semester, he teamed up with three others, including then-high school students Conrad Kramer and Nick Frey, to create an app called Workflow that automates iPhone activities. The app essentially lets users create their own apps. It won the top prize at the event.

About the same time, Messrs. Weinstein and Kramer applied for a Thiel Fellowship, which provides two-year grants to young people to drop out and pursue ambitious ideas. It has tapped 82 fellows in the past five years.

I dont think college is always bad, but our society seems to think college is always good, for everyone, at any costand that is what we have to question, says Mr. Thiel, a co-founder of PayPal and an early investor in Facebook.

Of the 43 fellows in the initial classes of 2011 and 2012, 26 didnt return to school and continued to work on startups or independent projects. Five went to work for large tech firms, including a few through acquisitions. The remaining 12 went back to school.

Mr. Thiel says companies started by the fellows have raised $73 million, a record that he says has attracted additional applicants. He says fellows learned far more than they would have in college.

Messrs. Weinstein and Kramer were accepted and moved into the Mission Control house in June 2014. That summer, they reunited with the team that won the Michigan competition, including Mr. Frey, who was about to start his freshman year at Iowa State University.

The Workflow team worked out of a loft in the citys South of Market neighborhood, sharing space with a startup founded by two other dropouts: Zain Shah and Ishaan Gulrajani. It provided a glimpse of startup reality.

There are no hard numbers on the dropout trend, but applicants for the Thiel Fellowship tripled in the most recent year; the fellowship wont disclose numbers. Applications to Y Combinator, a well-known startup incubator, have more than doubled to thousands in the past two years, says President Sam Altman. Mr. Altman says he receives emails every day from ambitious college or high-school students asking if they should skip college.

Colleges frown on the notion. William Aulet, managing director of Martin Trust Center for MIT Entrepreneurship, compares the people encouraging students to leave school to sports agents who lure college athletes to turn pro.

There are a lot of bad things being done, people saying you need to drop out to be a good entrepreneur, says Mr. Aulet. 99.9% of people, if not more, should stay at places like MIT.

Frank Pfenning, who heads the computer-science department at Carnegie Mellon University, says formal education helps students adjust as technology changes. These foundations are needed to push the boundaries beyond just writing code, he says.

Mr. Weinstein seemed destined to become a technology wunderkind. He started installing software on the family computer at age 4, and gained notoriety as a teenager for creating a program to jailbreak, or modify, an iPhone to install unapproved software. During high school, he co-founded a startup that built software to sync documents and pictures between Apple Inc. devices. After high school, he worked at a startup for a year, earning more than $100,000.

If youre a young, technical founder, you carry almost zero risk, says Dave Fontenot, 21, a Mission Control resident who dropped out of the University of Michigan after his sophomore year to start HackMatch, a job-placement firm for engineers. He says it is easier for him to place dropouts than new graduates.

Its almost a bigger risk to stay in school and let people like me drop out and start things before you have a chance, he says.

Many tech companies welcome young talent, and dont require employees to have a college degree. Facebook Inc., Google Inc. and others offer internships to teenagers; Facebook last year hired an 18-year-old intern for a full-time position. Yahoo Inc. in 2013 bought news-summarizing app Summly from now 19-year-old Nick DAloisio for $30 million; hes currently a product manager at the company. This week, Apple promoted 20 apps created by developers under 20 years old in the iTunes store, noting that these fresh talents prove innovation and creativity transcend age.
In their day, those founders were very unusual. But a lot has changed since 2005, when Mr. Zuckerberg left Harvard. The new crop of dropouts has grown up with the Internet and smartphones. The tools to create new technology are more accessible. The cost to start a company has plunged, while the options for raising money have multiplied.

Moreover, the path isnt as lonely. Many of the baby-faced entrepreneurs in Mr. Weinsteins house have known each other for years, via Facebook groups, Twitter and a thriving circuit of weekend technology competitions called hackathons.

They call the house, above a vegan taqueria in San Franciscos Mission District, Mission Control. It resembles college housing, complete with a sink full of dirty dishes and common living areas cluttered with empty pizza boxes. In the bedrooms, clothes spill out of open suitcases.

Not long ago, dropping out of school to start a company was considered risky. For this generation, it is a badge of honor, evidence of ambition and focus. Very few dropouts become tycoons, but failure today often means going back to school or taking a six-figure job at a big tech company.

Near the end of his freshman year at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ari Weinstein was offered $100,000 to drop out of school.

Mr. Weinstein, now 20, had grown up immersed in technology. He created a website at age 7, started a software company in high school and released an iPhone app his first week at MIT. The rest of his freshman year, he juggled classwork along with tending to the app.

The $100,000, from a fellowship sponsored by billionaire Peter Thiel, offered Mr. Weinstein a shot at his dream: starting a company with friends. But he wrestled with the decision in the spring of 2014, worried that he was giving up on college too soon and afraid of disappointing grandparents who valued education. His mother had other concerns.

I thought he would miss out on the social aspects of college, says Judy Weinstein. Its the bridge between childhood and adulthood, a built-in transitional time.

Mr. Weinstein chose the fellowship. He and a growing number of others believe they dont need the bridge of college and are starting companies before theyre old enough to drink. In San Franciscos Mission District, Mr. Weinstein shares a house with 11 others, including seven who also ditched college to pursue startup life.

The college dropout-turned-entrepreneur is a staple of Silicon Valley mythology. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg all left college.
for only 50 follows
how the hell does he have 3000 twitter followers???

holy shit manim blown away by mattermarks ceo
/giphy plebeian

haha
ohh
more time to play tetris
thats awesome
jesus man
haha its not a biggie
:disappointed:
i wanna, but vince doesnt have any rackets on him
haha
chat about it over the tennis net
hm, lets chat about it in personjust a lot to write down
<http://www.ribbonfarm.com/>
quick recap so I won't forget and so you might remember, we talked about:
-bitcoin/blockchain technologies
-21
-smart contracts, Storj/Maidsafe (airbnb for diskspace startups), Ripple, Augur (prediction markets), etc.
-cryptocurrency to established currency/commodity as a vacuum to establish new crypto
-ACH technologies, established finance within that space
-culture in defining infrastructure and creativity
-pain-tolerance mechanisms during hard running or exercise
-and probably other stuff
was good
im sure i can find someone for symposium v2.0
anyways, i know a bunch of people who love geb at stanford
thats probably the best defense for why religion is so big even within academic circles
like godels theorem, it requires something out of our system to prove things within our system
thats the highest level of abstraction for usfitting, because we cant go beyond our own consciousness
yeah, i mean i feel like thats where everything hits a barrier
cool stuff right
haha
relates back to our conversation about meaning, and where does meaning derive from
basically that you need to go out of the system to create meaning within your system
from what i understood, there are statements about a system that are unprovable with the system
spans the tangible and abstract easily
godels incompleteness theorem is pretty cool
haha
not a valid reason
and that makes me less inclined to want to read it hahaha
i feel like its a cult classic for precocious high school kids haha
i tried way back when but it was too dense, and got weird reviews
have you read GEB?
tru that
damn
hoping to eventually start generating revenue
taking out rounds of funding
yeah im basically a startup thats levering and levering
hahah
for my future??????? :O
a proxy war?
is this an activist investor
lmao
yeah, really though
which i liketheres a de facto unfair advantage
tbh relational investments, from private equity/vc asset classs to human relationships, are pretty inefficient because theres so much information asymmetry
its just that most ppl might say thats basically social life, but i think that its just as important and serious as investing real cash in stock market
yeah haha
anyways, yeah investing in friends is pretty much having the money to spend on going out with friends, buying food, getting ubers, etc
no stares
no guilt
yeah exactly hahaha
but its pretty difficult, and generally having liquid cash makes it much easier, which is a sad truth
well i mean you could socialize without expending cash
youre investing in your relationships
dont like framing it like that though, too broad of a term
hm i guess
haha
right
per se*
yeah
like making new friends takes some element of cash
haha i just added that part in, but he seemed to agree when i mentioend it
but yeah
and 2 siblings
but he said that didnt want to be indebted to parents since he doesnt have good relationship there
didnt probe too much
dont know
yeah pretty crazy
/giphy lolcat
lolz
well anthony is also out on student loansdidnt want to take parents money
yeah
i think the best thing to do with my money is to expand and strengthen networkneither he nor i have much liquid capital
friends
might as well
invest in self and others
i asked anthony about this stuff toohe doesnt invest his money in public equities
idk
yeah thats attractive sure
haha
ehh
true true
at least thats how i see it
might as well specialize and contract out that macro thinking to others who specialize in that
idk man no matter how macro you try to go, since its not your job youll be median if lucky
hahah
found this article that explained it well: <https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-time-for-an-interest-rate-hike/2015/08/23/853d7e70-49a5-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html?tid=pm_opinions_pop_b>
didnt think about any of that lol
interesting
chinas pretty wild
thats true
everybody was so distracted with talking about private companies valuations
and we were all so blown away, but you didnt hear too many ppl saying oh wow this is a bull market, too good"
we entered this bull market
makes sense

social media tends to polarize/binarize
but its super nuanced, better left off the court of social media
bc you can argue that saying these terrible things could legitimately hurt someody
this is where trigger warnings get funky though
which he doesnt lol
as long as he doesnt threaten real harm to others
eh, i understand that hes completely free to say whatever he wants
but less about his use of the n-word and about other stuff related
and told me to get off my moral high horse
and then we got into an argument until he got pretty pissed at me
the hard r always kills me
lmao
sometimes
he would just drop the n-bomb
but he didnt really say it in front of him
bc our third roommate was gay
at first i was like you cant say that!
lol andrew han does
its pretty sad
and not something that could be corrected pretty quickly
as if their ignorance was a fault of their own
that could be construed as ignorant
ive met people who get very worked up and actually angry at others who unintentionally said something
oh def
trigger warnings are scary bc they try to place the moral weight of a killing on an action as slight and unintended as America is the land of opportunity"
yeah
yeah
ehhhh

scratch the 'when'
i dont understand microaggressions and when i feel that oftentimes people who parade against microaggressions can be macroaggressive to the ignorant
definitely feel bullied by thought policers
agree with sentiment though

its an ohlone online course
but that barrier isnt all too high
i just dont see this as a killer opportunity right nowseems more like a standard risk-adjusted return
whats the chances they cant do this already for themselves
given our target is people who are already real estate investors
but how many of those are there?
yeah
well were representing buyers right?
also seems that its not so easy to get good properties without the necessary relationships
we should interview her
his mom is full-time
yeah
or not
successfully
do you know anybody whos doing this?
haha
if an expensive house turns out to be fucked up, were fucked
thats a lot of liability man
if we wanted to do this, wed start as bottomfeeders
they probably want to use one who has experience and connections
but dude, i cant imagine that people buying expensive homes are ok with using some random ba's
sounds like lots of costs for potentially no gain
and all sorts of different checks to make sure house is alright
lol you gotta pay for termite tests, pest stuff
ba is liable
if the house ends up being fucked up
seems that you pay buyers agent almost as insurance
read the comments
<http://www.zillow.com/advice-thread/Bypass-the-Buyers-Agent-and-Win/457838/>
you sure thats how it works?
ah I see
so why would a buying agent want to pay 2-3% more
how can we be charging industry standard when we have so little exp?
hm isnt 2-3% the industry standard?
idk the people ive met doing house flipping were like poor lyft drivers
but i just think that the space must be pretty arbed out
im down if the costs make sense
:thumbsup:
no clue but id assume not
i mean per deal
and accounting
but wed also need legal help and all that shit
dont know enough
not going to though
lmao

Will u be up?
Prolly later though
Haha
9?
Morning?
Tmrw?
:disappointed:
Darn I left my wallet in your glove compartment <@U087XT8AX> 
Sure
Exactly
Let's get dinner here
I should be done before that but just in case
Let's do 7
Damnnnnn
Oh u whore
How
Wait what
companies dont always have to dump money into tech though
i mean i would feel undervalued too but i just wouldnt leave
that seemed to be their differentiation and moat
it seems that they rely a lot on their service
yeah
i dont think all top talent thinks in the way you defined it though
haha
just saying
i still strongly disagree, and think this would be better discussed in person with a whiteboard and markers or some shit
equity is truly market value
salary is a very static measure of value
not really
yeah
my feel is that the move gains new talent
its unfortunate that they lost some people bc of this move
theyll be gaining new talent
they shouldnt be in that company
it makes no sense for those people to stay to begin with
thats why i said
so they should leave
sure
they would probably leave anyways
in which case, it only makes sense for them to leave
then they were prolly not that bullish in the companys new talents ability to grow the company, and the cos ability itself to scale non-linearly with those new hires
and if a person is bummed that they didnt get more pie than someone else that theyre used to getting more pie than, and that is the catalyst for their move
but their slices still contain the same amount of pie
its natural for some people to be bumemd about that
look at it like this, people who used to have bigger slices of the pie now have smaller slices
culture exists in individuals, in friend groups, in startups, and in corporations
and i think that trying to build a certain culture is idealistic and progressive, but culture always exists
I mean, I dont know their culture, but probably where everyone feels secure about the future theyre building together, where people are being compensated at the level where everyone can feel secure about their future
hahaha
and new talent also being brought on
but clearly, they did not fit in the culture of this company
theyre not bad stuck up people
i dont think this is something about objective need for money for those top performersits just that they feel that their work has been devalued
ceo still gets 1mm annually, lower people get paid their 40k salaries and top performers will still get their raises/bonuses whatever from the companys profits
if he wasnt going to do this, then for those top performers, they dont have any better access to money
he took money that was already allocated for himself
he didnt take money out of a future allocated pool or shit like that
thats separate from a ceos base salary thats already set
the way that bonuses always work
thats bonus dude
no dudeits coming straight out of the ceos salary though
this is not even self interest
if they saw someone else make more money than them
sounds like these people would politic no matter what
and im arguing that those people are probably not the best for a company
if i were to boil it down, youre arguing that people who were higher up will feel worse that theyre not making multiples more than the people below them
hes not hiring 50k people for 70k salaries...
exaclty as you said, market will supply according to the price
doesnt say they have to be low talent
yeah
vs. subjective valuation of salary
its a matter of objective valuation of salary (which did not change at all or only for the better if it did)
the market theory thing i think does not apply at all
hes simply guaranteeing that those that were already hired (i.e. needed for their roles), will be compensated
hes not guaranteeing jobs to people that apply for those jobs
hes not compensating anyone less
and that he got the shorter end of the stick by giving up his salary?
do you think that this ceo was fairly compensated for his work before hand?
thats absolutely not true
that isnt contracted out already
what type of job
who do you think is low-talent
really cant judge this guys decision without understanding the company behind it, but seems that the top talent isnt necessarily the dev's
seems that their business is a marketing business with developers
so?
eh
its like saying that paying interns more when other interns used to be paid less is affecting incentives
but sure
thats besides the point
those salaries already existed
its like saying that paying interns when other interns are unpaid is affecting incentives
it just raises the bar
it doesnt affect incentives
he lost some talent but if that talent gets disgruntled by other people getting higher pay, and then decides that alone (or maybe in conjunction with other factors) is enough to make them leave, then thats fine
i really dont think theres a right answer here but seems like ceos getting short shrift for making a move that his pretty stable company could afford
sure but that doesnt make that structure significantly better
its a matter of deciding whats a reasonable salary for your workers
raises arent like manna raining from the sky
i mean thats how working for a company over an extended time works
?
i honestly dont see how that makes the ceo stupid...
and he still left
the dev who left was making less than 70
the dev who left got bumped up 41 to 50
as it stated in the article
41 to 50
thats what happened
again, it wasnt immediately given to them
but below 70k, ppl still dont feel completely secure for future
beyond 70k, theres very little difference in happiness levels and the like
there are numerous studies that say that 70k is the threshold for general stability
otherwise, they shouldnt be hired
if they were hired, they clearly brought value to the company
i dont think it caters to least talented peoplethats harsh
yeah
morale*
i dont think its about making them work harder
but he realized that he was making more than he needed and wanted to reward his workers
ofc not
he did
why?

cool peeps
Stanford friends, hung out with them last night
what do you think?
makes it easier to incorporate interested friends
was thinking of making another slack group around book club
loll
which is kind of annoying
I cant do it without inviting them to everything else

like you have to incentivize students to be interested in using the platform, but also have enterprises trust that they can source interesting and valuable people off of it, and transfer their hiring workflow to the product as well
but this problem straddles the two
most companies are either consumer-oriented or enterprise-oriented
such an interesting problem
lolz
i think
have the right connections to make it work
I feel like I could do it though
haha
START UP
haha
and you could do smaller commissions
and businesses would too
right?!
which sounds great to me
and low tech moat
but theres clear social network effects
which is hard
but itd have to have the right incentive structure
i think thatd be a cool startup
haha
no kidding
bc makes more sense imo for students to nominate other students
like an internal referral system for college students
there should be a better network for that kind of shit
man recruiter life sounds like something that college kids should do more often
i wish
hahaha
straight chilling after this
yee
yeah
yeah
assuming 100
just 1 would be my whole summer internship salary from goldman
lol yeah no kidding
haha
but yeah its fucking nice of them
haha its standard i thinkjust searched to make sure
i think 15% of annual salary after 6 mo retention
just dev's
haha
yeah its pretty nice of them
and recruiters commission
$1k/mo
to help with recruiting
im just on-call
part time
loll no
fuckyeah
im on ongoing contract with neighborly
damnnn

thats amazing
holy
thats pretty good
oh shit nice
what rank are you on linkedin profile views?
damn thats intense
i guess i thought engineers had more decision making power over that stuff
just surprised me
no clear opinion
goes against the builder mentality that I see when I think of engineers/hackers

generally presentability is important for human relationships and making sure you make the maximum no of relationships
while cs gigs are about projects that you did yourself or with your clique of friends
finance gigs are often about relationships/connections
at the risk of making sweeping generalizations, cs doesnt rely on other people so much, while finance does
cs not so much
finance does greek
finance yes
cs-y types not so much
depends

same as a bypass surgery
lol hes a fucking class iii device
anyways, wanna hit up the asian art museum thing?
LOL
not sure the benefits yet
yeah
im recovering, might be able to take a dose on friday
lolz
theres also an event at asian art museum
lol sure
i should be more precise
yeah its a pretty broad concept
thus, asia will morph and shift to keep up pace of industrial innovation
in the sense that there will be opportunists who then go to asia because its not really found a model of innovation and might be lagging behind in very clear gdp ways (which it hasnt so far)
i was saying tbh it will have tothe world arbs itself out"
but in the sense that asia will find its own model of innovation
not trying to go so high resolution
haha yeah
it isbut it hasnt really failed me
oh definitelyits an opinion piece with a very very clear thesis
tbh it will have tothe world arbs itself out
right
haha
ill agree with that
yep
hm yeah
buy going back to that open source idea

vincenttian [2:04 PM]
i think the culture of america and individualism really helped it be a big player in open source

yeah but still
too much to read
guh I now feel vincents pain
im a very strong "narrativist"
i alredy disagree
hm interesting article title
and the fundamentalist in me cries against that heresy haha
and his religion is humanism (man as god, man as creator)
just think that its a matter of religion
idk about level, but symposium part i was fun
haha
yeah, i feel like vincents right about the intellectual fwb"
interesting

lemme invite you to old event
ahhh forgot i didnt invite you to bc you were gone before i could host first one

we connect on an intellectual level, not so much on a deeper personal level
like people I admire, but cant necessarily hang with
thats actually pretty on-point
hahaha
lolz
but now, im wondering if theres a specific type of relationship that allows for higher-than-expected value conversation
just invited whoever i thought would be good fits
im just asking aobut the who in symposia bc i didnt start these knowing that was the case
lol what really
and easier to do with certain hs acquaintances
easier to do with strangers
hard to do with just hs friends for sure
realized that theres a certain select group of people whom I could do it with
<@U087XT8AX>: do you think you have a good friend group that you could do symposium style events with?
lolz
and libertarianism
some of the intellectual foundations for the Right/conservative way of thinking

a lot of what startups want me for is for recruiting help

but this is more accessible

symposium v. 1
I need to be able to work off it, not just repeat it, but not have new insights on it
i generally share things that I can elaborate on, and build off ofI guess thats the best way of me using a thesis
but I just havent read enough of it where I feel comfortable sharing it
that being said, I admit that this isnt that huge or anything so far
and if more people think risky, then there becomes more noise
haha its like ways of looking at the world that enable me to better evaluate the opps i have
or cant use
things that I have already figured out how I want to use
yeah, but cool theses that are already arbed out
which is selfish
the fewer that people think of this, the more advantage there is
dont want to retweeet
no
lolz
<@U0882HKA7>: youd appreciate: "If you are an adult over 30, especially one encumbered with significant family obligations or debt, the decision is harder."
just a taste: This does not mean, of course, that there are no political consequences. Software-driven transformations directly disrupt the middle-class life script, upon which the entire industrial social order is based. In its typical aspirational form, the traditional script is based on 12 years of regimented industrial schooling, an additional 4 years devoted to economic specialization, lifetime employment with predictable seniority-based promotions, and middle-class lifestyles. Though this script began to unravel as early as the 1970s, even for the minority (white, male, straight, abled, native-born) who actually enjoyed it, the social order of our world is still based on it. Instead of software, the traditional script runs on what we might call paperware: bureaucratic processes constructed from the older soft technologies of writing and money. Instead of the hacker ethos of flexible and creative improvisation, it is based on the credentialist ethos of degrees, certifications, licenses and regulations. Instead of being based on achieving financial autonomy early, it is based on taking on significant debt (for college and home ownership) early."
