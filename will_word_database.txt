haha
righttt?
thats awesome
oh fuck yeah

lol the whitepaper that introduces bitcoin and blockchain
or that^
<https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf>
report on the bitcoin xt fork
such a hot field
lol dude read about bitcoin so much to learn
maybe not peer reviewed
tons dude
really interesting stuffnew version of bitcoin
<http://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/inside-the-fight-over-bitcoins-future>
<https://www.ethereum.org/>
but still reading through everything
storjcoin is interesting imo
ppl getting scammed and shit
pretty wild westtypical high risk high reward dynamics
and various fora
no real details yetive just been reading up on bitcointalk
<@U087XT8AX>: <@U0882HKA7> any interest?
Im considering looking into altcoin
truly the next big wave is about data curation
it feels like this could be a whole new revolution where before computers/internet enabled widespread dissemination of information, now computers/internet enable widespread processing of information
1 pb on amzn costs 17k
you can start crowdsourcing computing power to execute massive scale projects so that the ordinary person can start to compete with any large enterprise in terms of raw computing powerright now its not that liquid
all that kind of computing power makes folding@home kind of projects much more possiblethink about kickstarters asking not for cash but computing power
see ya
and all server power across Google, MS, AMZN, server farms, etc. makes up only 6%
apparently, all of googles server power amounts to 1% of all bitcoin mining computing power
and all this via just the bitcoin mining community as proof of concept
in which case actual computing power becomes transactableyou can see people doing much much more with their ordinary computers and access to cloud computing
as opposed to server farms
ultra low human operating costs
according to them, theyll be selling space cheaper than amazon, google drive, etc.
lots of cool applications
yeah
just a little worried we might lose a spot at the table after they talk to bigger vc's
yeah, looks like a very cool concept and great traction
yeah
im hoping to invest haha
yeah
or if you think its a cool idea, you can get involved at no cost and no reward
if you have 10k storjcoin (sjcx) ~$600, then you can start getting paid for your space too
theyre going to launch their test group b tmrw i think
yeah
allow people to run their own mini servers
imagine when you start paying people for their disk space
except folding@home basically asks people to donate space
or seti@home, the precursor
yeah!
let companies store their encrypted data onto spare disk space of random people around the world
trying to make a decentralized cloud
the above are articles written by <http://storj.io|storj.io>
<http://metadisk.org/metadisk.pdf>
<http://storj.io/storj.pdf>
or all altcoin?
bitcoin specifically?
hahaha
maybeit shoudlnt be
or technology
it makes it just a subtree of the larger blockchain industry
but since bitcoin uses blockchain as a core technology
maybe not laterally
i think theyre pretty similar
#fuckyeah
lmao
difference between blockchain and bitcoin?
sounds like some rap lyrics
do that at my place, its no biggie man
lol do you really think that or were you trying to trigger poor botty
haha thats the life
fucki cant watch too much shit doe
i heard about it
ah shit
i fucking die
its amazing

hahahah
although I feel like that was pretty much what i said
thats good
oh shit
fuck nitish
so fuck him
journalist calls vc, vc calls me, i get shit
and then he turned around and fwded it to the journalist and implied that students were reading fwded accounts of this journalists emails
lol I forwarded him an email regarding event with vc and nytimes journalist
so fuck him
and he fucked me over
also that writer was co-editor of dish daily with me

<https://truckerpath.com/>
the trucking industry has a bunch of startups that are starting to gain traction
loll
not imo
or at least into blockchain
i really am
and also stanford frosh send off
theres a bitcoin conference wed/thurs
what time?
prolly not actually
hm maybe
land of the free to land of the [trigger warning]
yeah lol
yeah
right right
when i hear that, i know im getting a tirade
thats a fucking trigger warning
than the word offensive"
sureid rather hear a thesis
then person b should just leave
either aggressor or aggressed
remove person from situation
and theres no possible way for everybody to get together and determine what is not hurtful and what is
or Where are you from?"
im sure theres one person out there who legitimately feels threatened when someone says America is the land of opportunity"
right, its a pretty gray area
damn low*
i bet this article makes the point that the threshold is too damn high
well theres thresholds right
ehill just keep reading
as if they arent ppl at all
with no concern at all for the emotional well-being for those non-pc people
where pc people apply this thats bad argument to non-pc people, but if non-pc people say thats bad then theyre censored or shat on
theres this kind of double standard
right
hm i see
i think its importantdissenting views are important to consider
it is though
so it can work against common sense, and even what we might term progress"
but, like most things in life, its double-edged
its just as beautiful a testimony"
and this girl was like, thats what makes sociology so greatany one persons view is as valuable as a majority goups view"
like, <@U0882HKA7> and i were talking to some of my friends last night about the discussion we had about culture v infrastructure in shaping the ideas around family ties
rightbut anyones view is as valid as any other's
that emotional harm is just as legitimately harmful as physical
trigger warnings are rooted in the idea that words do hurt
and thats why the comparison is made to the campaign in the  80s against hate speech
its a tough line to draw
even though it is more psychologically taxing
but people still would choose more options if given the choice
decision fatigue is so real, especially in times like recruiting season adn shit
super interesting
People who instead believe that self-control is an infinite resource are less likely to show effects of ego depletionthey actually show increased performance on self-control tests after completing boring, ego-draining tasks like crossing out es from a document. Even weirder, how you feel about free will also affects your productivity: The more strongly you believe in it, the more likely you are to enjoy making decisions and to be happy with your choices.
reactions being slack emoticon reactions
you know?
like train it by using our reactions
would be cool if we could supervise the bot...
<@U0882HKA7>:
man t his uploaded a file trigram thing should be removed
i just thought, yeah, standard ignorant shit"
i didnt see that it was jay
lmao
oh wow
~~~
or a maroon/forest scarf
i have a nice green tie im looking to wear
not sure about tie, what was dress code?
i dont have a good fitting suit, but thinking of doing a navy color schemenavy chinos and navy/slateblue blazer
lolz
So serious
Damn
Y u up so late
Whoa
its a good way to train me to speak more directly
i almost wrote i feel like instead of i think ^
i think we should remove the i feel like trigram
haha
doe*
happy for ur friend do
and i cringed
i saw that i feel like"
damn man
but kind of how futurama is
i dont watch futurama
geeky
a bit crass
its just hilarious
as i am for you to watch rick and morty
haha idk im not so excited for kids to read hp
i think rick and morty
ehh
haha
i wish i could go back to the first time i saw rick and morty
lucky
damn
they have a ton of them online for streaming
adultswim
I can probably borrow somebodys tho
i dont have a sleeping bag on me tho

yeah
next week is finals
around then i think

lol
ahhh
wine bar in palo alto
why are they going up?
danny crichton, newest crv partner, hes also the most junior
sunday evening
do either of you wanna get drinks with me and a vc from crv?
<@U087XT8AX>: are you around bay this weekend?
ive never grown up anywhere else
everything
haha
but at the time must be scary bc the politics
in hindsight
ehhh
what a rocketship
yeah
his company*
he was scaling companies when im interviewing
i mean its so weird
yeah
hahaha
with practically zero experience scaling
except youre calling the shots
like the learning curve of becoming ft employee
thats what weirds me out the most
isnt it weird that this has been his one and only real job
lol
but makes me feel really stupid sometimes haha
and spending is fun
earning money is fun
man i get it
puts into perspective our culture around earning and spending as well
makes me realize money isnt the goal
haha
dang
?
haha bc its a boyish name
wow
he has a daughter?
whoa
its pretty incredible
wow
yeah
thats pretty crazy
oh wow
did he donate?
zuck?
etc.
like whats the most common types of question asked on formsprings
and scraping for certain things
and then try to test by diggin up old shit
would be cool to sketch out a few theses on human interaction
actually
and formsprings
like myspace profiles
like history classes will be using so much more interesting/accessible/engaging artifacts
yeah the data
sorry haha
the article
the pulitzer finalist article was only found in a cd the writers friend kept
lmao
just disappeared one day
i read this one article where a pulitzer finalist
unarchived
like web pages disappear all the time
even the web isnt as persistent as we thought
i think itll be the new kind of archaeology
dude i hope so
but in the end, much of our generation is defined by the tech services we use
which has triggered a lot of other stuff (shifts in morality and understanding, sharing, etc.)
is the tech we have
or i guess the thing that really differentiates us
i think ppl are pretty similar tho
and dont have standard metrics for morality, but rather go with what the majority think
how we are super reactive
twitter shaming is really interesting
and how we deem right and wrong
what we deem right and wrong
social media shaming
and enabling
i thnk its reflective
like so much stuff happening
finstas
fb/twitter
tinder
like examining our interactions on social media
also think theres a lot of cool stuff with tech studies
the situation above is more about morality
yeah
so many new things coming up tech wise s.t. our modern sensibilities of law/morality cant keep up sometimes
law is so ripe
yeah
lots*
lots of edge cases
its cool
yeah
morality wise
how much culpability do we assign the actor
lets say actor then tries to do everything to stop the action from going through to time B
but the action itself is binarized by decision state at time A
like, if during the course of an action (lets say shooting somebody), defined as starting at time A and ending time B, the shooter decides, wait, I dont want to do this"
kind of touches on theory of cognition
or in decision-making?
like where does culpability lie in accidents?
well based on modern sensibilities
how to determine culpability
is much more interesting
or philosophy of law
i think philosophy in literature
gross
yeah
so then practically speaking, your paradigm is dependent on your paradigm
so even if there is an objective y/n element, its not going to be proven decisively
i guess its rooted in me thinking theres no way wed ever *really* know
regardless of my opinion, my opinion makes it true
i just dont think it matters
yeah
to argue a very binarized q
incredible bc its so complex
the modern philosophy has gone to pretty incredible formal logic
definitely
i hated my life when i was doing my free will/theory of consciousness class
yeah trust me
and its already mind numbing jsut reading the first paragarpha
on free will
a good overview of the positions of the various philosophers
<http://www.informationphilosopher.com/freedom/standard_argument.html>
trust me you dont want to read up more on this
nice
lol i think that it can refute hard determinism
i think its starting to crumble
but with advent of quantum physics
hard determinism jives better in humes time
lol
there can be space for morality even with hard determinism
ive read some stuff that argues
well
yeah
but consciousness and free will are pretty intertwined
actually that goes more towards consciousness than free will phil
i think
theres stuff like p consciousness and a consciousness
ohh
nope
yeah
hm actually, i think that was an arg for hard determinism lol
where the nerve potential precedes the conscious desire
and i thnk some problems in neuroscience
i think like there are problems with the origination of action
im starting to remember some of the args
neuroscientist turned theory of mind philosopher
have you read chalmers?
i forget the args against hard determinism tbh
interesting
lolllll really?
haha
yeah
which philosophers is he reading
the philosophers i mean
haha
annoys me
yeah
guh
i think it matters nil
after taking so many classes
i dont care
lol
I feel like that was the first big thing that I missed out on
Ppl*
Lol man so many pop
a few months ago, was low 200s
pretty crazy
yeah
lol just a month ago it was almost 500
around 330
haha
good thing i bought haha
up 20% since last week
wow btc  jumped pretty high
and then writing scriplets?
whats so bad?
are you building it from wordpress template?
haha
whichever has more trigrams
or vincebot
put in kunalbot
haha i just thought willbot was particularly sharp
not so clean cut as just switching man!
i wonder how different theyd sound from each other
lol id like to see kunalbot and vincentbot
whoddathunk
interesting
cyber for short?
cybersex?
lol had no clue
You bought it?
Loll
Meant for more formal wear
Patent leather is also pretty hard to maintain
Oh wow on contract for so long
Edgy
Ooh nice
Unfortunate
No
It got like 300 engagements
Accel retweeted it when it first came out
Loll
yeah
oh twitter
linkedin?
pete rood
rood
v nice
v nice
lol yeah
altho hes the vc that called me when nitish threw me under bus to that nytimes guy
lol go for it
just interesting look at #humanities in #tech
sounds terrible
i should edit that
oops
too cliche
lol take out the ideas and perseverance
yeah
Jeez that's terrible
not unless hd becomes what it used to be
can hdmafia ever expand
not unless paypal becomes what it used to be
can paypal mafia ever expand
idk man
haha
relying on that #hdmafia
yo <@U087XT8AX> read my medium articles and give me a heart (<http://www.medium.com/@iamwillkim|www.medium.com/@iamwillkim>)png>
anyways thanks
you also get access to a lot of free wifi
hahaha
lol
uber for wifi
yeah
anyways, i really gotta go haha
you could generate passive income by selling it off when someone needs it for a minute or two
what if you wanted to sell access to your wifi (granted that you lived somewhere more high traffic)
you leave for work and dont come back for a while
e.g.
i was thinking more like individuals auction off their wifi when they dont use it
and across cities
wihtin communities
yeah, I think wifi or bandwidth is another one
and you let your device know
if youre really busy, youre willing to pay more
one scenario thats brought up pretty often is for self-driving cars to negotiate and auction for right of way
but to create a micropayments system where devices with 21 computer can now communicate and negotiate
the way I saw it, its not to generate a meaningful income for consumers
haha yeah from what Ive heard, most consumers have stopped
haha it is low payout for individuals operating on human needs for sure
mining pools dont need supercomputers, they just need lots of computers devoting just a fraction of operational time
think about how mining pools operate
wihtout the variable costs of electricity/maintenance
without having to charge consumer directly
but recurring revenue streams
yes, higher upfront cost
its like trojan horsing btc
bc the value the miner is generating is flowing back to the producer
what you do pay for is the electricity and maintenance of your device
you just buy subsidized shiteven if you dont care or know what btc is, you get it cheaper bc your device is now a kind of indentured servant
its about embedding mining software into things with access to cpuswhether its in a car, tv, usb, or pc
its not about selling mining software
first
look at 21
wait wait
why not?
i dont think youre representative of the typical consumer tho
lolll
this is a pure consumer play
you could truly make crypto for the masses
what if changing mining software was as simple as a software patch
doesnt need to be just btc thothe mining software can change
what do u mena inefficient
hahaha
embed miners in all hardware so you can give out shit for free and then the machine can pay for itself
iot play for btc
we did on bitcoin and 21
oh yeah dude you shouldve come to the first sympo
and crypto fora
but you should look into some btc fora
gotta go
anyways
yep
and fronting the money
but venmo is paying for those transaction costs
i mean tipping is just like how consumers _think_ venmo works
the usage will come
i think its more about showing that the computing power supply is already in btc
already the btc computing power network exceeds the computing power of google, yahoo, msft, fb, amazon combined
like i think this could be the revolution of our generation
i think its possible in less than a decade
yep
yeah, true true
yep
gets way more efficient access
its like social lube
or even fractions of cents
all with just a few dollars
aggregating enough computing power in seconds
buying wifi bandwidth
tipping
think about micropayments
p2p is huge man
is inherently centralized
corporate use of their own versions of blockchain
im more interested in the p2p aspect
yep
ah, are you considering corporate buy-in?
its not about lack of people wanting to create networks thoits about buy-in from consumers
havent really considered the ramping-up point necessary still
when btc is truly arbed-out
but then youre starting to think like 2100 era
its very very difficult to offer the same liquidity that btc offersand as it becomes more mainstream, there will be value created in other cryptos for sure (just by nature of how btc is deflationary)
bitcoin is the way that blockchain propagates
covered this exact point
LOL
look at my tweets actually
but bitcoin and blockchain are so intertwined
i love blockchain, but hate bitcoin"
thats a classic statement
haha
visa is heavily investing
citi already has a whole bitcoin division
but what makes these so much more exciting to u?
haha yeah yeah ive heard of these
i mean alternative crypto's
oops
haha i didnt mean altcoin in that way at all
in a way that wasnt before possible with linkedin referrals/recommendations
i was thinking the recruiting thing I talked abou (peer-to-peer referral system) would be built on top of blockchain, so you could maintain an economy of reputation
lol cant have to go back to java
last i heard they were trying to do crypto stuff to capture reputation
look into kpcb edge
fiat money*
currency != money
its the same
how?
theres so much scamming in altcoins tho
yep
make for more volatility
all these altcoins
they had their own storjcoin
remember storj?
lots of currency risk
its why storj wasnt that great
thats a lot riskier
yeah
oh lolll
yeah its cool bc it holds value in a nimble way so that you can capture microchanges in ways you couldnt before
i still dont understand what you mean by area of focus"
youll get better coverage
you should read some oreilly books on it
yeah
haha
lol ok
lol what did they cover?
btc is pretty liquid
yeah
what do you mean separate from btc?
theres already services where people are using btc for trading commodities
also ach is mostly for very large amounts
dont need clearinghouse i think
if youre the bank
direct access to buy/sell orders
exactly
yeah
is just huge
but that it was done open sourced
it makes sense
its already huge
yeah
the $10 bonus helps too haha
I already appreciated like 18%
nice tho
nah just 355
btc is pretty crazy
buy buy buy
haha
Why are the shareable numbers so low
hahah
lol im only at 345
dont have time!
lol
no
lol
yeah
woo figured it out finally
bleh
so hopefully should be ok
weve set up our gitignore
probably not worth it
in less than a week
lol im just wondering if its worth trying to set this up and getting the others on it
yeah
jeez
ahh, I see it in eclipse all the time, but never heard about using it LOL
no
its so bad
changes build path and the settings folder is used to keep track of the file structure for each user
and shit
like dependent on where you download your jar files
but yeah
sorry I said it wrong, when i said machine specific, I meant specific for each users setup
SOS
howd you do it <@U087XT8AX>
<@U087XT8AX>: did it
actually I mean its not impossible
and im frustrated
theyre frustrated
its fucking impossible
thats exactly how its working rn
haha
idk
you can't
lol
so taht eclipse can configure workspace
for file structure
I think its machine-specific settings
and then commit, then put it back
i think im gonna just take out the .settings in gitignore
yeah
sorry, it was
yeah
no
hm, still not there
bc its in the gitignore
I thought that it wouldnt commit it?
no
haha
oh..
the directory is no longer there
have you had this issue before?
but when I checkout to another branch and then coome back to the original branch, I no longer have .settings
but is in the gitignore
i put in a .settings directory in my directory thats being tracked with git
quick git question that I cant figure out
yeah
should go recruit at babson
willbot hits home
dang
harder tahn i used to think at least
i feel like its really hard to find people work with
lol no idea
haha
yeah
lol
lol :sob:
this is so bad
lol
guh
didnt get shit done at all this break!!
crazy
were going to meet tmrw
they cant even meet today
and thats why eclipse is confused
I mean, my file structure significantly changed
actually, I think that metadata is going through fine
well damn
ah
what?
so eclipse cant find shit
like they changed the file structure
wtf
they changed it so eclipse cant even open it
fuck
of their own
they did some funky shit
fuck
fuck
fuck
but now the project doesnt even open
idk what happened
yeah
the java class
lol im going to be working with the other guys on cs108
yeah
ooh
Damn
Hahah
is the reason why the code doesnt work if the node to be deleted is the last node in the linked list that you cant set the current object to null; at best can only set the nodes value and next field to null?
im down for that
cheesy sticks
lol
okie
did you guys get qs on linked lists?
hahah
lol wow that was pretty funny
yeah that should work for me
what time?
probably
bleh
so that means id have to caltrain then get on bart
i thought wed meet in berk
lol no
yee
that makes my life easier haha
lets meet in sf!
gotta caltrain then bart
im in stanford
more like arrive 7 or 8ish
probably later
generally risky
lol didnt want to put my name behind that
tx for the like <@U087XT8AX>
lollll
yeah
and looks legit
and then others will see the community rising around it
the hardest part
just fake the early adopters
yeah it must snowball
goddamn
and profit
and then use that as a signpost of your clout
just buy fake comments, shares, likes, etc.
knowing that peter kim buys fake twitter followers i bet this is how they launched
if others think its shareworthy then youl lwant to share it
power of suggestion
yeah
hm
im sure you can
i wonder if you can buy youtube views
i choose bots
lol seo or bots
since you have to have unique ip addresses
must be harder
anyways, I wonder if theres an easy way to generate traffic...
exactly
yeah
what happens in slack stays in slack
not scamming anybody
no
wait
yeah
lets try it
wait thats genius
then you make money
if the price per comment is lower than the advertising pay per comment
thats how they must do it!
holy cow
to advertisers
then turn around and peddle these numbers
and fake traffic
they must buy fake comments
these ppl are not fucking real
lmao
gonna tweet that now
#thotleader
fuck yeah
shiterate
how can you iterate on shit that profits from being shit
iterate what?!
jesus
are you fucking kidding
holy cow
lol
hahahahaah
FKE FUCKERS
fuckers
clearly fake
but each of their posts get less than 100 likes
has 280k likes
lol shareablys fb page
haha
classic pinterest play
you can aggregate but curation is hard
all of that would take original work to make it flow
lol
yeah its so hard
is hard
trash
consumer shit
building really really good
to get that traction
that sounds liek a shit ton of work
right
sure
yeah
ohh ok
wait, these articles still seem like original contentare you sure that these are copies?
arent these original content creators though?
lol really?
i think building out a site that churns content is a bit harder
lolz
i wonder how much advertising spend they do
yeah
i wonder what their margins are
300k gross rev?
thats pretty crazy
yeah man
student networks??
love is fleeting
lmao
anyone we know
yeah haha
hahaha
yeah
with his freshman year ra
no
hahahahahahahaha
hahaha

<@U0882HKA7>: how much of a joke was the student-networks startup thing you were talking about
lol
<@U087XT8AX>: you know any other product manager internship roles?
tenks
and kind of flashy
too expensive
i dont use holder haha
Ya
See ha
Wow
Links

qq 
Also my website is not mobile optimized yet 
Switching made a big jump

I love the tool
Sketch is so great
Lol engineering projects are just scraping stuff
Yeah
Lol I'm sleeping now haha
<http://Willk.im|Willk.im>
Sucks to suck
Guh I missed the pm deadlines for Google and Twitter 
And gonna be working on school projects
Lol I just touched up my website
you're up??
whoa
haha
i have business cards
But really hard to do right I guess
Was interested in these kinds of startups 
I tried
Shitty product too
See gocommando 
Basically students should be able to pay other students to access information that they'd otherwise have to research
I've been thinking that there should be an in person kind of glass door 
And a bunch of block chain companies
Trying to do this
Premise I think is one startup
Yeah I think polling is pretty big
And Vincent you mentioned your uncle and his use of polling?
Didn't I tell you guys that idea
Wait that polling idea 
Silicon Valley edition
It's like American psycho
Damn 
heard that there were potential lawsuits
well i think that was particularly nasty
from what i heard
it got kinda nasty
yeah
swedish math guy
the other one is a good friend of mine as well
since they had no money in
lol one of the kids was pretty wealthy and the other was founder, the other two got forced out
forced ut
selenium scripts probably
haha
pass a Twitter Turing Test"
of fake accounts that act semi-real
im thinking of making a twitter empire
dan got cut out
neoreach is interestin
maybe idk
haha
so i never clik
i though it was aphishing thing
is it the verifier?
no
idk
haha
incorporate some basic ai
would be cool project
shouldnt be too hard
i should make something like that
pretty clever
and stuff like that
and follower/following ratios
they classify just based on twitter activity
you and i have almost 100% real users
called it
Lmao
Should run it there
There's a tool online that lets you check what proportion of a user's followers are probably fake
Looking at his tweet favorites and stuff
It looks fake
Hmm
Is done in one minute
Over the course of severa months
All my accretive follows
In one fell swoop
Lol
Oh wow
What do u mean
Jeez
Man maybe I should just go ham
Yeah
You have soooo many followers
Damn man
cronjobs~~
I'm just running it everyday
^.^
actually, Ill just message you
also, <@U087XT8AX> what was your day to day at pandora like
hm not sure
is he going back?
seems like cool program
nvm, there are things online haha
is he smart?
cant find info on glassdoor
and whats the interview like?
what do they say?
thinking of applying
have either of you met any yelp pm interns?
title of my next blog post
from microagressions to microtransactions
thats life in the tech age of micro-everything
yeah i mean #socialmedia
#heartforheart
can i get a heart man
sooooo
ahhhhh you sneaky
yeah its pretty cool
good stuff to think about
i liked it a lot
yeah
they have them as a little escapable window
shortcuts
was super easy
haha
i just used their ui
medium markdown?
:heart:
please read and &lt;3/recommend
just some notes on a guest lecture on design
<https://medium.com/@iamwillkim/irene-au-guest-lecture-at-stanford-design-class-86788aa0edd1>
put up my first thing on medium
all of this increased usage will mean a huge amount of value created
there will be some kind of winner in the space eventually who will crack the adoption problem and with time, itll become more and more normal to purchase a crypto like btc
best way to have diversified exposure is buying btc instead of investing in any  given startup
which I think is a kind of paradigm shift in how people interact
and the future of fintech and most of the micropayments space
btc is just such a big part of blockchain tech
just gonna hold it
you buy $100, you get $10 more and i get $10 more
buy buy buy
<https://www.coinbase.com/join/564a457d82fc0b28890000c8>
coinbase
lol
bought my first $101 worth of btc
Haha
Yeah I just tweeted it
ft job is so diff i bet
haha
doesnt sound like internship shit
ah yeah
what was it
nais
<mailto:wkim1@stanford.edu|wkim1@stanford.edu>
hax on hax
hahaha
gotcha
like youve worked on projects where people have implemeneted?
what does touch entail haha
or is it more to display a high level understanding of how everything works and the ability to go deep-ish
its a lot haha
have you used all these technologies?
sounds more marketing-oriented than se
<@U0882HKA7>: what do you say for ab testing?
haha
Haha gucci 
Ah ok
Like databases or data structures?
Data storage?
Haha
In terms of difficulty 
What's "avg" question like
Yeah
How much dp stuff so you get asked for internship
What's the range on difficulties?
Mannn 
I forgot so much shit
Just started skimming ctci 
Not yet
Haha
Damn
How's it not really fit?
I'm so unprepared for interviews haha
Do you know which ones?
Bleh 
Like fit first then tech? Or technical first then fit?
For tech interviews, is there an ordering of the first interview and later rounds?
Yeah might have to stay in Berkeley if past 12, since last Caltrain is at 12 I think
Lmao
Yeah count me in
Ah tempting
haha
where you just write for nanowrimo
just met some people who were taking a creative writing class
yeah damn
i work slowly i think
anyways, no work done
yeah
and some other friends
edward
have you had baijou?
ended up getting boba
no
object oriented programming class
damn
but failed
i tried to work
lol
#responsibility
they indeed could have been better worded
yeah v true
loves her mom and stuff
yeah
haha happy shes happy
haha me too
oh shoot right
any places I should put in apps for?
/giphy leverage
#leverage
can i just say
haha
theyre a lending company
yeah makes sense
small company, huge growth potential, amazing network
affirm is hot shit
ah nice
spray and pray baby...
zenpayroll, affirm, wealthfront
yelp, airbnb, robinhood
going to send out apps to the big tech cos faceGoogAmaSoft
lol im compiling my list rn
ok
ugh
why less projects?
red black trees and shit?
algo shit like theoretical stuff?
anywhere from 500 to 5000
larger startups
or invoke him in #willbot
stop invoking him
dudeeee
any recs on se/pm coding interview prep stuff?
any recs on se/pm coding interview prep stuff?
ah ok
or its a preposition
about isnt a noun is it
did it cover most of the qs you were asked?
any interview prep materials that are particularly good?
ok
do they end recruiting cycles so soon?
damnn
and public tech cos too, just nothing too small
bigger startups
or pm
looking for se gigs
damn
im thinking about waiting till winter
whens a good time to start recruiting for summer internships?
yeah makes sense
haha
for botty
<@U0882HKA7>: did you use pymarkovchain?
asked them to compile list of different 3pl startups
and market research
to do due diligence research on companies
i just started using <http://askwonder.com|askwonder.com>
can it do research for me?
maybs
you know?
i just want to have it
do anything
idk
that blows
damnn
wait does maryanne have invites for m?
ahh nice
seen as up-and-comer in fintech
gs did a hackathon with them awhile back
theyve been super popular
Idk tho never really thought of them as career opportunity 
Kensho is cool
ill be working on two class projects doe
ooh thatd be fun
:(
994 corbett was the shit
hahahaha
holy cow af
whoa weird
willbot, what do u think about this
shieeeet
for a dorm event
yeah haha
not great
back on campus
i wish
lol no can't
should go to berkeley
its a sign
willbot
Nor she me
I don't even follow her on Instagram
Beautiful
Lmao
depends on the seeds rate of follower counts
i guess, but I need a list of like 10
i look at all their followers
seeds
damn, maybe I need to load all my output logs...
problem is that Im overlapping now because I unfollow ppl and then my bot will follow them again when I see them
using your 20% followback as a benchmark
should average me about 0.075*followersCount new followers per day
im going to make it start following anywhere from followersCount/4 to followersCount/2 amount everyday
i guess
fuck
loll
yeah
what else?
i do!
i dont know how my follows fare over time
haha
i  need a cohort analysis
you know what i realized tho
ohhhh your twitter followers
like what?
whoa really?
even willbot agrees
hahaha
oh haha
there has to be
somebody has that data
looking at internal rhymes from nltk (i think nltk has that data?)
or a rap
or making it a huge sonnet
like using only harry potter corpus
but you can define really quirky features
markov chains would prolly be most sensible to begin
isnt that cool?
haha
its flipping the nanowrimo contest into a bot writing contest
haha
its creating bots that can write nanowrimo novels for you
<@U087XT8AX>: look at nanogenmo
Yeah just a masters program where you complete 45 more units in grad level courses
lululemon shorts
lolllll
global offices
lol yeah
yeah thats weird to think about
yee
Wooo I'm coterming!
lets do it there
<#C0C0VJK0V>
some kind of funnel is def necessary tho
yeah
i dont have time for those meetings
lol
hm yeahi dont want to send too many of those emails tho
nais
this might be my content generation play
im thinking of tweeting them
haha yeah
and if it matches funding thresholds, itll send it over to me
and then pull companys profile from cbs api
its just a simple whitelist scraper rnlooking for things like raise series astartup" investor etc.
haha i assume same  quality
info asymmetry = power
scraping is so importantif we posit that there will be a scramble for attention and use of those resources, then its more important than ever to automate tasks like information aggregation
im now scraping tc articles and emailing myself potential seed-stage companies for varsity
hue hue hue
move to <#C0C0VJK0V>
yeah
hm the tweeting within last 7 days is good
but not getting great following numbers
yeah I look at most of these
hey that was pretty good ^
what does that mean
"i like at so many things?"
like?
what criteria?
yeah, content generation is really hard
gotcha
oh ok
how do you monitor that?
wait, your content quality?
and cheap
whoa that place is beautiful
lolz
doing what?
back to twitter bot?
lolz
oh right
mr. cai??
do you know whats causing the error?
jeheheheheheheheh
hahahahahahahaha
eh?
need to watch myself
wow i said mang"
jehehe
nice
it would be so real
you should make it terminate upon punctuation
hahaha
yeah draper u is pretty expensive
tim draper?
nope
yeah
def within reach
haha
whenever theres known scarcity, theres huge attention devoted to optimizing and meeting demand
esp if you start thinking of human working memory as a tool that can be optimized like chips (a la Moores Law)
the implications here are pretty interesting
haha
and retweeted it
i just read it
interesting stuff
unless by best you mean popular
haha i dont know if it means best
whoa nice
whos that?
they have an algorithm to determine if and when to lift the limit
Lol I think they lift that eventually
idk
lolz
yeah its impressive
haha
very nice
not bad
nicee
<!channel>: should give this article a read if you have time <https://medium.com/backchannel/techs-high-barrier-to-entry-for-the-underprivileged-da254356547d>
yeah thatd make it potentially more quotable
hm does it not incorporate the trigram in entirety?
do you think
nice
or is this just trying to trigger first
hm whats related to wsj?
its in ingleside i think
i think its intense summer program actually
or summer program
I think so
met the kids
its a really great program
i think its almost a year long program
anyways, thats longer-term, like maybe a year
one app was like yik yak for city projects (e.g. if you see a problem, you report it, and other ppl can upvote it)
that are pretty interesting actually
they teach kids ios, and these kids build out apps
<http://exploringtech.org/>
theres some great programs taht are doing it successfully tho
yep
yeah i bet
haha i can tell
haha
and longer-term implement a teaching coding program thatll have code-literate hsers and college students teach underserved students how to code websites, and have them build out websites for local businesses for cash
gonna reach out to a few underserved youth entrepreneurship programs for partnerships
to do the grass-roots level fundraising
talking to danny from flex to see if he can bring in some hs talent
and <http://drapervarsity.com|drapervarsity.com>
lol
trying to revive hdmf actually too
just work
haha that was a real question?
yeah
tru
thats annoying
damn
ohh
i def didnt paste the wsj article 30 times
wth
is that how many instances are in the chat?
wait whats the count?
wow, did it just respond to your willbot command?
or just take like top 100
oh do a 4-gram
as in too sparse?
bigrams then?
lol do you need a trigram?
thats what i had in mind
ah ok, yeah thats what i had in mind
what do you have in mind?
shouldnt the trigram alone be related enough?
jehehe
youre pretty much a bot for bots
hows that meta?
wait, is it triggering with  will bot or withrandom trigrams
hm yeah
jehehe
hm yeah
yeah
respond to trigrams it currently has stored
like instead of responding to the x-bot" command
when it sees a bigram that it has?
can you code it to randomly interject once in a while?
maybe itll die out in a few weeks tho
haha
yeah host this!
<@U0882HKA7>: you should blacklist the bot commands when pulling bigrams
/giphy singularity
they speak to each other
oh no
vincentbot
that was pretty weird
wow these are intelligent bots
yeah
but itd be hilarious
hahaha
it doessss
where people try to guess whos who

Maybe we should speak in complete sentences so that your model looks better
haha
and its still this fuckin weird
lol trigram??
and you just do a bigram model?
slack api lets you pull all the messages of a user?
ohhh nvm you copied and pasted the output
or the whole chat?
copied and pasted for one user?
is this the slack bot?
wow that was quick
Also wanted to do stuff looking at some of my follow backs, if there's any kind of significance to follower/followed ratios, given that I have a growing dataset of follows 
Based on trending links from credited sources
Or finding a way to generate semi unique tweets
Hm I was thinking of doing something similar with tweets
i am doe
lol
i was considering taking this class and then pussied out
lmao howd you find this
mission?
dont remember him
and have our own tasting
i guess we could just bring wine
damn
wow that sounds really fun

I like Harper's monthly better
<@U087XT8AX>: New Yorker can get hectic since its weekly
Lol it's so bs
All this press shit
Wtf

Lol watches are hard
But the startup accidentally cc'd me when giving directions to Pete
I just know that he was supposed to send me an email marketing some startup when I was editing for tech blog
Nope
Lol Steve ballmer's son is in two of my classes this quarter
gotcha
can you say if their product is up and running?

i wonder how many startups get into winklevoss mansion
theyre raising?
nice
i mean dray*
hows dispatcher doing
man
lyfe
lol
pretty crazy
like all these consumer brands we see had to start at scratch
but i was on forbes list

yeah
or 10 year, really
as opposed to the lifestyles ppl lead living on a 100yr time scale
to encourage thinking about time on a bigger scale, and thus inspire more forward-looking, sustainable actions
^ theyre making a clock that rings every century, millenium, and 10 millennia
<http://longnow.org/clock/>
the way you present the data can really warp it to fit the persepectives of the user
its like looking at binary number representations vs. decimal number representations
yeah its a great pont
the time shit blew my mind haah
yeah exactly
rightt
youre just the seed
nah
haha
<@U0882HKA7>: now poaching your friends
jesus
lol
second app to make more follow calls
but scared that might be too much
Im tempted to make a second app
dang how many you follow?
haha nice
nice
ah nice
haha
still 6 dollars down
woo
a bit desperate
that sounds interesting
no
loll
one day Ill be the pmarca of twitter
one day Ill catch up to y'all
btw, <@U0882HKA7> has his twitter bot running now too
etc.

he had a great piece on plants though
nah
michael pollans amazing
psychedelic*

<@U087XT8AX>: what irc client do you use?
so ttyl
i gotta sleep doe
yeah
and spamshit
definitely
so many bad tweeters
yeah, realized why twitter sucks
fun to try to optimize
idk, its kind of fun
haha #thoughtleader
but got it running on digital cloud server, which i learned a bit from
the api is simple
pretty trivial code
eh both
didnt want ppl to see this shady shit
private repo haha
at random intervals of 2sec to 2 min around 12AM
and does a random amount from 15-25 followers daily
new update will look at descriptions for keywords like startup or stanford for more relevance
follows second-degree followers
haha
built out that twitter follow bot
just hoping to do more coding
yeah
good show
although I did watch some rick and morty
haha no time mang
crazy how much weaker i can get
yeah i started going to gym recently too
but not sure this is the way to go
i think peer referral is super huge
interesting
like that
Conversation is the antidote to the algorithmic way of looking at life because it teaches you about fluidity, contingency and personality."
interesting
like the solitude ~ empathy thing
reading it now
havent gotten to it
that shit compounds
get it checked
holy dude
So much time required
Haha
Nah
Geb is huge at least for symsys kids

Lol Kunal's gone by then
damnnn la hacks is april
damn wanna go now
haha really?
partying no fun?
haha yeah i feel that
hows it going?
still after all this, they still made fun of him, on AIM"
did you see trellos?
haha
lolz
?
whats meant by interruptions in meetings ?
thats cool
interruptions in meetings in what ways
why did they give you that training?
oh interesting
i feel like i care about winning a lot
...
after playing catan
idk man
lmao
sucks
but no ones wired that way
like i think if people were more open to thinking and less about winning life would be so much simpler
guh
news sources are hard
LOL
i also feel that nyt is a bit much sometimes
hm
did they say that on the record?
that was weird
yeah it is
i feel that way bc they dont do active pieces on how things should change but just complain about random things
not because they actually believe it
idk i feel like they push their liberal agenda since its the most profitable among yuppie millennials
haah
this didnt help
i really dont like jezebel though
exactly
not at all like the slaves directly benefited
slaves using knowledge on farms, against their will (being slaves), makes it seem manipulated
I totally dipute it
weird
but thats because I believe in one group, one voice
haha, I think you are
and i think its important for history to show each voice, while noting what is majority and what is not (most or some or rarely are good signposts for instance)
not majority group, majority voice
sociology is premised on the idea that one group, one voice
if it does
and is that bad?
do you think sociology distorts truth then?
interesting
though I cnat speak to my unconscious intent, etc.
and I do not mean to be deliberately against the author
which goes completely against the author
Idk, I just think the publishers have a shitty job, and they did really well
less lazy and clumsy, more resigned to lazy and clumsy middle schoolers who like to binarize
but I also think this was a middle school textbook
I think they could have worded things better
haha
skimmed that part I guess
what was that
eh
you learn that there were random acts of kindness among Nazis too
in the same way that in hs, you dont learn that every German who served in the army was terrible
and evil
in fact, the textbook I think shows the multifaceted nature of slavery
so whats the issue
middle school students from texas*
I feel like noone, not even students, will come out of any education, esp not reading this textbook, that slavery was in any way ok
because Im not evil like all those shitty slave owners"
you think then that slavery is something that youre incapable of
thats what really breeds misunderstanding
wow, all slave owners were so bad
like
I really dont like when textbooks show only one side
yes, but thats what I think is important about it all
thats not untrue!
strange to me that we read it so differently
wait did the textbook ever say there were upsides to slavery?
feel like this should be in another channel haha
literallydid not see a single real problem
but the textbook itself has no real problems
what do you think the author is trying to say?
hence clickbaity
or even whitewash it in a way thats distinct from anything else in this patriarchal, cis white society"
subtle things that are mostly saying that it sounds like people want to say slavery wasnt that badbut the textbook, when I read it, didnt read like that. I agree, some of it could have been better worded, or was unnecessary. However, I dont see how thats trying to defend slavery
all the points are sheer semantics
thus, why it reminded me of the social media flame wars and sjw think
if you applied this kind of scrutiny to any textbook, you could say the same exact thing about anythinggay rights, trans rights, civil rights, etc.
anyways, just thought that this author is literally looking to poke holes at something that doesnt really have too many problems, just to make his real point, which seems to me, look at conservatives, look at texans, look at their shit education system"
they skimmed, at best
most of the other students I knew at msj def didnt read the textbook
idk about you, but I read the textbooks at hs and I still ended up being the most influenced by the teachers
teachers are who actually will deliver and execute on the material
first off, the textbook doesnt affect teachers one bit
which is pretty misleading
and defines a conservative pov
as if this textbook defines texas
however, the article focuses on that as the main issue
to argue on semantics in a middle school textbook, where people arent reading for subtlety seems useless
Textbooks arent the real issue, teachers are; as long as textbooks are impartial, and present the truth, whatever it is, thats the best we can ask for
heres my pov
and I was looking for tactics theyd use to try to get readers to just agree right away
yep
more skeptical than normal i guess
I approached it with what I was hoping was an open pov
i didnt read it at all that way
lollll
like obviously I dont want to defend saying that slavery had not bad parts to itthat most of it was all evil, but unfortunately real evil is pretty humdrum
idk its like an inconvenient truth
you cant bury one point away because not enough people felt this way"
thats sociology
<@U087XT8AX>: can you explain what the author said as to why this structure is bad for learning?
obviously I have strong opinions on this
That discourages critical thinking
i understand that the book might not be the most nuanced view. its a middle school text book. I think hes straight up wrong that the book discourages critical thinking. I dont see how offering an emotionally-charged, strongly-worded passage against slavery is going to help students think about the full picture. Reading persuasive writing in an informative textbook is just plain wrong
i really really dont like how he picks on a middle school textbook for not offering the nuanced views that sociology journals espouse for their academic readers
I read it and imo the text was pretty clear that it was bad, and the slaves had to cope
ppl should have the clear this is what was bad and this is how they made it work argument, and figure out that the bad is still bad
thats absolutely false
thats like saying that uncle toms cabin is a bad book because it implies that slavery was good at some points in the relationship
idk man
it wasnt good partsit was talking about suffering, and how the slaves coped
of course not
the argument is not so clean cut as that!
The textbooks attempt to actually be more unbiased and present what was the case is drowned out by overzealous sjws who think that history has to be rewritten to cast everybody whos against them in a negative light
this kind of shit makes me upseti feel like if this were better written, I might have even fallen for the sensationalism. It all feels a lot like the social media shaming flame wars
To say that all slave owners were pure evil, all slaves were pure good is totally mindless
like what is this author trying to advocate? All slave owners were pure evil ? I doubt hes that dumb. He clearly wants a nuanced discussion of what slavery waswhen he gets it, he says its not nuanced enough
seems like author really just wants to feed liberal readers the same drivel that Texans are evil people, texans are racists etc, when thats a gross overgeneralization. HMH is a national publisher, and to say that theyre trying to soften slavery is ridiculous. The text thats quoted as being riddled with omissions (btw, that sentence is pure deceptive wordplay, trying to conflate riddled with errors with omission, which, tbh isnt fair unless its quite clear theyre omitting a large part of slavery in a MIDDLE SCHOOL TEXTBOOKtheyre obviously not going to be able to fit all the nuances in properly) is not actually bad. It states both sides. Slavery did result in the formation of African-American cultures, and the family was a very large part of creating those cultures
and looks more sensationalist than anything else
lol this looks so so clickbaity
lmao
the tweetstorm has landed
wait, theyre doing drayage services?

damn hackmatch has been around for almost 2 years
man should have made a separate channel for this..
Mr. Fontenot, who moved in in September and most often wears University of Michigan pajama pants and startup-company T-shirts, says hes found a sense of community in the house that he thought hed miss by leaving college. Anytime I have doubts about myself, I have the housemates right there, he says.
for only 50 follows
how the hell does he have 3000 twitter followers???
man I lost a lot of focus in some ways

more so than in asia though
korea has the highest suicide rate
no way
where the lines between truth and fiction are very blurred
but on an open-sourced community
hm, maybe but when you can fictitiously create images that look real
i think there is a problem when they can fantasize about this dude that has been created by open-sourced communities
dont think tech is a catalyst
yeah definitely
problems with hacker culture, open information??
yeah i read thiscrazy shit
whoa so late??

:disappointed:
i wanna, but vince doesnt have any rackets on him
haha
chat about it over the tennis net
hm, lets chat about it in personjust a lot to write down
<http://www.ribbonfarm.com/>
quick recap so I won't forget and so you might remember, we talked about:
-bitcoin/blockchain technologies
-21
-smart contracts, Storj/Maidsafe (airbnb for diskspace startups), Ripple, Augur (prediction markets), etc.
-cryptocurrency to established currency/commodity as a vacuum to establish new crypto
-ACH technologies, established finance within that space
-culture in defining infrastructure and creativity
-pain-tolerance mechanisms during hard running or exercise
-and probably other stuff
was good
im sure i can find someone for symposium v2.0
anyways, i know a bunch of people who love geb at stanford
thats probably the best defense for why religion is so big even within academic circles
like godels theorem, it requires something out of our system to prove things within our system
thats the highest level of abstraction for usfitting, because we cant go beyond our own consciousness
yeah, i mean i feel like thats where everything hits a barrier
cool stuff right
haha
relates back to our conversation about meaning, and where does meaning derive from
basically that you need to go out of the system to create meaning within your system
from what i understood, there are statements about a system that are unprovable with the system
spans the tangible and abstract easily
godels incompleteness theorem is pretty cool
haha
not a valid reason
and that makes me less inclined to want to read it hahaha
i feel like its a cult classic for precocious high school kids haha
i tried way back when but it was too dense, and got weird reviews
have you read GEB?
tru that
damn
hoping to eventually start generating revenue
taking out rounds of funding
yeah im basically a startup thats levering and levering
hahah
for my future??????? :O
a proxy war?
is this an activist investor
lmao
yeah, really though
which i liketheres a de facto unfair advantage
tbh relational investments, from private equity/vc asset classs to human relationships, are pretty inefficient because theres so much information asymmetry
its just that most ppl might say thats basically social life, but i think that its just as important and serious as investing real cash in stock market
yeah haha
anyways, yeah investing in friends is pretty much having the money to spend on going out with friends, buying food, getting ubers, etc
no stares
no guilt
yeah exactly hahaha
but its pretty difficult, and generally having liquid cash makes it much easier, which is a sad truth
well i mean you could socialize without expending cash
youre investing in your relationships
dont like framing it like that though, too broad of a term
hm i guess
haha
right
per se*
yeah
like making new friends takes some element of cash
haha i just added that part in, but he seemed to agree when i mentioend it
but yeah
and 2 siblings
but he said that didnt want to be indebted to parents since he doesnt have good relationship there
didnt probe too much
dont know
yeah pretty crazy
/giphy lolcat
lolz
well anthony is also out on student loansdidnt want to take parents money
yeah
i think the best thing to do with my money is to expand and strengthen networkneither he nor i have much liquid capital
friends
might as well
invest in self and others
i asked anthony about this stuff toohe doesnt invest his money in public equities
idk
yeah thats attractive sure
haha
ehh
true true
at least thats how i see it
might as well specialize and contract out that macro thinking to others who specialize in that
idk man no matter how macro you try to go, since its not your job youll be median if lucky
hahah
found this article that explained it well: <https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/no-time-for-an-interest-rate-hike/2015/08/23/853d7e70-49a5-11e5-846d-02792f854297_story.html?tid=pm_opinions_pop_b>
didnt think about any of that lol
interesting
chinas pretty wild

social media tends to polarize/binarize
but its super nuanced, better left off the court of social media
bc you can argue that saying these terrible things could legitimately hurt someody
this is where trigger warnings get funky though
which he doesnt lol
as long as he doesnt threaten real harm to others
eh, i understand that hes completely free to say whatever he wants
but less about his use of the n-word and about other stuff related
and told me to get off my moral high horse
and then we got into an argument until he got pretty pissed at me
the hard r always kills me
lmao
sometimes
he would just drop the n-bomb
but he didnt really say it in front of him
bc our third roommate was gay
at first i was like you cant say that!
lol andrew han does
its pretty sad
and not something that could be corrected pretty quickly
as if their ignorance was a fault of their own
that could be construed as ignorant
ive met people who get very worked up and actually angry at others who unintentionally said something
oh def
trigger warnings are scary bc they try to place the moral weight of a killing on an action as slight and unintended as America is the land of opportunity"
yeah
yeah
ehhhh
paid 15 for this
damn
whoa
<http://www.amazon.com/Teller-Other-Essays-Politics-Meaning/dp/096550297X>
were reading The Bank Teller and other essays on the politics of meaning"
btw, do you wanna join vince and my book club?
oh that might explain
im considering reading something on their history, want to learn more
yeah
most singaporeans i meet are super proud
hm

yeah, my friend showed me

its super thought police and 1984 style
<http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0>
lol thats all of social media
yup
lol why
scratch the 'when'
i dont understand microaggressions and when i feel that oftentimes people who parade against microaggressions can be macroaggressive to the ignorant
definitely feel bullied by thought policers
agree with sentiment though
why but
no prob
<@U087XT8AX>: you coming today?
its a beaut alright
ah shit nice
ice that shit
that sucks
wtf
get dylan to come and play coup

language is just a layer, would be interesting to finally be able to communicate exactly what I mean
telepathy I guess
100% effective transmission
and i hate those kinds of qs but i thought about it and realized that I want to be able to communicate without language
at the tea with strangers thing, they asked what your favorite super power would be
did i tell you about my desired superpower?
whoa wtf
hm
tangential, but i like how our picture backgrounds are so similar
need to talk to my parents about this
hm really
its an ohlone online course
but that barrier isnt all too high
i just dont see this as a killer opportunity right nowseems more like a standard risk-adjusted return
whats the chances they cant do this already for themselves
given our target is people who are already real estate investors
but how many of those are there?
yeah
well were representing buyers right?
also seems that its not so easy to get good properties without the necessary relationships
we should interview her
his mom is full-time
yeah
or not
successfully
do you know anybody whos doing this?
haha
if an expensive house turns out to be fucked up, were fucked
thats a lot of liability man
if we wanted to do this, wed start as bottomfeeders
they probably want to use one who has experience and connections
but dude, i cant imagine that people buying expensive homes are ok with using some random ba's
sounds like lots of costs for potentially no gain
and all sorts of different checks to make sure house is alright
lol you gotta pay for termite tests, pest stuff
ba is liable
if the house ends up being fucked up
seems that you pay buyers agent almost as insurance
read the comments
<http://www.zillow.com/advice-thread/Bypass-the-Buyers-Agent-and-Win/457838/>
you sure thats how it works?
ah I see
so why would a buying agent want to pay 2-3% more
how can we be charging industry standard when we have so little exp?
hm isnt 2-3% the industry standard?
idk the people ive met doing house flipping were like poor lyft drivers
but i just think that the space must be pretty arbed out
im down if the costs make sense
:thumbsup:
no clue but id assume not
i mean per deal
and accounting
but wed also need legal help and all that shit
dont know enough
not going to though
lmao
time to buy more soon
lost like $8
shit man, im bleeding on twitter
easier than blog post
basically a way for me to easily record my thoughts and theses and for people to be able to see those

i saw the tweet storm btw, nice

Damn lost 58 cents on Twitter
Will u be up?
Prolly later though
Haha
9?
Morning?
Tmrw?
:disappointed:
Darn I left my wallet in your glove compartment <@U087XT8AX> 
Sure
Exactly
Let's get dinner here
I should be done before that but just in case
Let's do 7
Damnnnnn
Oh u whore
How
Wait what
companies dont always have to dump money into tech though
i mean i would feel undervalued too but i just wouldnt leave
that seemed to be their differentiation and moat
it seems that they rely a lot on their service
yeah
i dont think all top talent thinks in the way you defined it though
haha
just saying
i still strongly disagree, and think this would be better discussed in person with a whiteboard and markers or some shit
equity is truly market value
salary is a very static measure of value
not really
yeah
my feel is that the move gains new talent
its unfortunate that they lost some people bc of this move
theyll be gaining new talent
they shouldnt be in that company
it makes no sense for those people to stay to begin with
thats why i said
so they should leave
sure
they would probably leave anyways
in which case, it only makes sense for them to leave
then they were prolly not that bullish in the companys new talents ability to grow the company, and the cos ability itself to scale non-linearly with those new hires
and if a person is bummed that they didnt get more pie than someone else that theyre used to getting more pie than, and that is the catalyst for their move
but their slices still contain the same amount of pie
its natural for some people to be bumemd about that
look at it like this, people who used to have bigger slices of the pie now have smaller slices
culture exists in individuals, in friend groups, in startups, and in corporations
and i think that trying to build a certain culture is idealistic and progressive, but culture always exists
I mean, I dont know their culture, but probably where everyone feels secure about the future theyre building together, where people are being compensated at the level where everyone can feel secure about their future
hahaha
and new talent also being brought on
but clearly, they did not fit in the culture of this company
theyre not bad stuck up people
i dont think this is something about objective need for money for those top performersits just that they feel that their work has been devalued
ceo still gets 1mm annually, lower people get paid their 40k salaries and top performers will still get their raises/bonuses whatever from the companys profits
if he wasnt going to do this, then for those top performers, they dont have any better access to money
he took money that was already allocated for himself
he didnt take money out of a future allocated pool or shit like that
thats separate from a ceos base salary thats already set
the way that bonuses always work
thats bonus dude
no dudeits coming straight out of the ceos salary though
this is not even self interest
if they saw someone else make more money than them
sounds like these people would politic no matter what
and im arguing that those people are probably not the best for a company
if i were to boil it down, youre arguing that people who were higher up will feel worse that theyre not making multiples more than the people below them
hes not hiring 50k people for 70k salaries...
exaclty as you said, market will supply according to the price
doesnt say they have to be low talent
yeah
vs. subjective valuation of salary
its a matter of objective valuation of salary (which did not change at all or only for the better if it did)
the market theory thing i think does not apply at all
hes simply guaranteeing that those that were already hired (i.e. needed for their roles), will be compensated
hes not guaranteeing jobs to people that apply for those jobs
hes not compensating anyone less
and that he got the shorter end of the stick by giving up his salary?
do you think that this ceo was fairly compensated for his work before hand?
thats absolutely not true
that isnt contracted out already
what type of job
who do you think is low-talent
really cant judge this guys decision without understanding the company behind it, but seems that the top talent isnt necessarily the dev's
seems that their business is a marketing business with developers
so?
eh
its like saying that paying interns more when other interns used to be paid less is affecting incentives
but sure
thats besides the point
those salaries already existed
its like saying that paying interns when other interns are unpaid is affecting incentives
it just raises the bar
it doesnt affect incentives
he lost some talent but if that talent gets disgruntled by other people getting higher pay, and then decides that alone (or maybe in conjunction with other factors) is enough to make them leave, then thats fine
i really dont think theres a right answer here but seems like ceos getting short shrift for making a move that his pretty stable company could afford
sure but that doesnt make that structure significantly better
its a matter of deciding whats a reasonable salary for your workers
raises arent like manna raining from the sky
i mean thats how working for a company over an extended time works
?
i honestly dont see how that makes the ceo stupid...
and he still left
the dev who left was making less than 70
the dev who left got bumped up 41 to 50
as it stated in the article
41 to 50
thats what happened
again, it wasnt immediately given to them
but below 70k, ppl still dont feel completely secure for future
beyond 70k, theres very little difference in happiness levels and the like
there are numerous studies that say that 70k is the threshold for general stability
otherwise, they shouldnt be hired
if they were hired, they clearly brought value to the company
i dont think it caters to least talented peoplethats harsh
yeah
morale*
i dont think its about making them work harder
but he realized that he was making more than he needed and wanted to reward his workers
ofc not
he did
why?

First essay on the Bank Tellers:

I had pip working but had to modify bash rc file for scrapy library config, and then I tried to install another thing, but had to reconfigure bash rc file and then reinstall pip
So stupid
Nvm, gonna just use virtual environment
btw, having troubles with pip
like you have to incentivize students to be interested in using the platform, but also have enterprises trust that they can source interesting and valuable people off of it, and transfer their hiring workflow to the product as well
but this problem straddles the two
most companies are either consumer-oriented or enterprise-oriented
such an interesting problem
lolz
i think
have the right connections to make it work
I feel like I could do it though
haha
START UP
haha
and you could do smaller commissions
and businesses would too
right?!
which sounds great to me
and low tech moat
but theres clear social network effects
which is hard
but itd have to have the right incentive structure
i think thatd be a cool startup
haha
no kidding
bc makes more sense imo for students to nominate other students
like an internal referral system for college students
there should be a better network for that kind of shit
man recruiter life sounds like something that college kids should do more often
i wish
hahaha
straight chilling after this
yee
yeah
yeah
assuming 100
just 1 would be my whole summer internship salary from goldman
lol yeah no kidding
haha
but yeah its fucking nice of them
haha its standard i thinkjust searched to make sure
i think 15% of annual salary after 6 mo retention
just dev's
haha
yeah its pretty nice of them
and recruiters commission

i guess i thought engineers had more decision making power over that stuff
just surprised me
no clear opinion
goes against the builder mentality that I see when I think of engineers/hackers
so weird to me that designers build separate from engineers
who builds up the mocks?
haha
nice nice

histrionic
melodramatic
generally presentability is important for human relationships and making sure you make the maximum no of relationships
while cs gigs are about projects that you did yourself or with your clique of friends
finance gigs are often about relationships/connections
at the risk of making sweeping generalizations, cs doesnt rely on other people so much, while finance does
cs not so much
finance does greek
finance yes
cs-y types not so much
depends
for some i guess
lol

this was prefaced with Marc Andreessens thoughts (the preface)the writer, venkatesh rao, consulted A16z a while back to talk about their philosophy so he could write about it in this series Breaking Smart

im considering trying to get involved with art museums
perf
<http://www.asianart.org/events/search?series_types=thursday+nights>
right by city hall
same as a bypass surgery
lol hes a fucking class iii device
anyways, wanna hit up the asian art museum thing?
LOL
not sure the benefits yet
yeah
im recovering, might be able to take a dose on friday
lolz
theres also an event at asian art museum
lol sure
i should be more precise
yeah its a pretty broad concept
thus, asia will morph and shift to keep up pace of industrial innovation
in the sense that there will be opportunists who then go to asia because its not really found a model of innovation and might be lagging behind in very clear gdp ways (which it hasnt so far)
i was saying tbh it will have tothe world arbs itself out"
but in the sense that asia will find its own model of innovation
not trying to go so high resolution
haha yeah
it isbut it hasnt really failed me
oh definitelyits an opinion piece with a very very clear thesis
tbh it will have tothe world arbs itself out
right
haha
ill agree with that
yep
hm yeah
buy going back to that open source idea

vincenttian [2:04 PM]
i think the culture of america and individualism really helped it be a big player in open source

vincenttian [2:04 PM]
but i think that same culture creates other problems, like gun control lol
<https://medium.com/@AnandWrites/the-thriving-world-the-wilting-world-and-you-209ffc24ab90>
haha, its just for records-keeping
Culture v. Infrastructure in defining family ties
sorrythis was just to notate our prior debate regarding:
harder to search
i dont like cluttering general with good discussion
yeah, we can prune later, but might be useful to have multiple channels and see what sticks
haha
yeah
oh just housing
like food and housing
no?
thatll def cost over $100
are we not staying there?
lol nfw
ok ok thats a bit dramatic
/giphy boo
havent really thought of it
idk, maybe I should go
these are pretty good
lmao
seems like too much money to spend
idk
haha
probably not
and covers the artful in the erotic
title is ars eroticaerotic art
<@U0882HKA7>: just read it, its well-written and funny
oh whoa really
im just letting them do their dirty work
tbh my twitter bots are more accurately termed twitter whores
hahaha
im a TWITTER PIMP
lol im not a twitter whore
code a twitter bot
haha jesus
and looking at the shame, drama, mystique around human sex with a new lens
great piece on what defines human sexuality/culture
<@U087XT8AX>: actually, Id highly recommend the above piece
ye
will be live tweeting itkeep yr eyes peeled1!!!1!!!1!
no flying to nyc for the blockchain conference haha
guhh
yeah but still
too much to read
guh I now feel vincents pain
im a very strong "narrativist"
i alredy disagree
hm interesting article title
and the fundamentalist in me cries against that heresy haha
and his religion is humanism (man as god, man as creator)
just think that its a matter of religion
idk about level, but symposium part i was fun
haha
yeah, i feel like vincents right about the intellectual fwb"
interesting
invited
lemme invite you to old event
ahhh forgot i didnt invite you to bc you were gone before i could host first one
hm some interesting snippets from art of self discovery (pasted way above)
we connect on an intellectual level, not so much on a deeper personal level
like people I admire, but cant necessarily hang with
thats actually pretty on-point
hahaha
lolz
but now, im wondering if theres a specific type of relationship that allows for higher-than-expected value conversation
just invited whoever i thought would be good fits
im just asking aobut the who in symposia bc i didnt start these knowing that was the case
lol what really
and easier to do with certain hs acquaintances
easier to do with strangers
hard to do with just hs friends for sure
realized that theres a certain select group of people whom I could do it with
<@U087XT8AX>: do you think you have a good friend group that you could do symposium style events with?
lolz
and libertarianism
some of the intellectual foundations for the Right/conservative way of thinking
^Just putting this here so  I remember to give this a skim
<http://fee.org/files/doclib/20121116_TheLaw.pdf>
I feel like reading is one of the most efficient ways of growing, next to conversations
but thats the price to pay for strong and cogent opinions
dont agree with him on everythinghes a fundamentalist humanist
and powerful
less than 2 hours read in allmoving
finished reading the book: <http://www.internetismyreligion.com/?recruiter_id=26809>
i didnt feel that way
interesting
ah lol
why?
ben horowitz wrote his preface for the book that came out of this talk
haha idk but it was good
interesting stuff
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-4WKle-GQwk>
will read
hm
only the first three or so essays
<@U087XT8AX>: havent read very much
should prolly go up a bit
<@U087XT8AX>:
or pure smart
if cool and engaging
bring some over for symposium
intro me to your blueprint bros haha
yeah hm
stacking teams
yeah
a lot of what startups want me for is for recruiting help
i was about to say thats like vc stuff
yeah
lol actually
i still dont see it though
youve said that before
loll
nice nice
but this is more accessible
ribbon farm
anthony recommended the parent blog of this series
anthony recommended, tyler already heard about it at a16z
symposium v. 1
I need to be able to work off it, not just repeat it, but not have new insights on it
i generally share things that I can elaborate on, and build off ofI guess thats the best way of me using a thesis
but I just havent read enough of it where I feel comfortable sharing it
that being said, I admit that this isnt that huge or anything so far
and if more people think risky, then there becomes more noise
haha its like ways of looking at the world that enable me to better evaluate the opps i have
or cant use
things that I have already figured out how I want to use
yeah, but cool theses that are already arbed out
which is selfish
the fewer that people think of this, the more advantage there is
dont want to retweeet
no
lolz
<@U0882HKA7>: youd appreciate: "If you are an adult over 30, especially one encumbered with significant family obligations or debt, the decision is harder."
just a taste: This does not mean, of course, that there are no political consequences. Software-driven transformations directly disrupt the middle-class life script, upon which the entire industrial social order is based. In its typical aspirational form, the traditional script is based on 12 years of regimented industrial schooling, an additional 4 years devoted to economic specialization, lifetime employment with predictable seniority-based promotions, and middle-class lifestyles. Though this script began to unravel as early as the 1970s, even for the minority (white, male, straight, abled, native-born) who actually enjoyed it, the social order of our world is still based on it. Instead of software, the traditional script runs on what we might call paperware: bureaucratic processes constructed from the older soft technologies of writing and money. Instead of the hacker ethos of flexible and creative improvisation, it is based on the credentialist ethos of degrees, certifications, licenses and regulations. Instead of being based on achieving financial autonomy early, it is based on taking on significant debt (for college and home ownership) early."

loll
That's awesome
Wait which library u use?!!!
Lmao
How are you thinking of implementing
That'd be really cool
Nice
Lolllll
well actually doesnt sound taht weird
and then later if they want to meet, its like, but dont wanna meet"
i feel like itd look weird if i just said, congrats
i gotta follow up with meeting
but either way
the whitelist doesnt help
etc.
mostly male
it went from like 70% tech interest to almost 90
like looking at the analytics.twitter stuff
lol its sad but these twitter bots are definitely making me more and more in a tech bubble
but I just want to know if theres a clearly better strategy
haha yeah it doesnt matter financially
i only have a couple hundred data points
at least
thousands of data points
you have enough info i think
well actually
haha yeah
but i wonder if it works
yeah it doesnt hurt
loll
and whether this favoriting stuff does anything
and who does follow back
if theres anything similar
but I want to know like who doesnt follow
yeah
i need to set aside some time to look at who follows back
tweepy
have you ever thought of monitoring the results
hope this works lol
i implemented the favorite thing
yeah
whats the cost for 200
no follows?
off of just likes?
wow
hahaha
i cant believe you use it for all that stuff
oh wow
for twitter stuff?
are you using selenium now?
yep
haha
thats how youve followed so many people haha
that makes sense
ohhhh
isnt that kind of messy?
yeah
right
field
tweepy has a in_response_to
yeah yeah
haha
oh really?
:3
what factors do you look at for which tweet to favorite?
that seems like a useful tactic
Im considering using your favoriting idea
at least Im hoping so
basically jsut does cronjobs but makes it easier to do, Im assuming it should be easier to get the error logs or any printed statements
its just a nice package thatll do scripts scheduling and stuff
woo gonna kill my cronjobs with this shit
<https://github.com/dbader/schedule>
or is it just returning some error?
are you sure its limit exceeded?
i dont think so
whoa
hue hue
everyday itll do a groundhog day thing and give a 50/50 go at whether its gonna follow anybody today or not
running the twitter bot on my server again ~~~~
do it
do it
